The prototypes TRITIUM-Aveiro and TRITIUM-IFIC-2 are reported in this section. The design of these is different from those of TRITIUM-IFIC-0 and TRITIUM-IFIC-1 and allow the reading of a large number of straight fibers with two photosensors operating in time coincidence. A better tritium detection efficiency was obtained for these prototypes through the use of a much larger number of scintillating fibers than in the preliminary prototypes, and time-coincidence read out of the photosensors. Furthermore, the activity of the radioactive liquid source employed was much lower than for the first prototypes to investigate the MDA. 

The main differences between the TRITIUM-Aveiro and TRITIUM-IFIC-2 prototypes are:

\begin{enumerate}

\item{} The diameter of the scintillating fibers, $2~\mm$ for the TRITIUM-Aveiro and $1~\mm$ for the TRITIUM-IFIC-2. The use of a larger diameter facilitates the flow of water around the fibers, reducing problems related to surface tension and ensuring that the entire active volume of the fibers participates in tritium detection. In addition, a large radius increases the rigidity of the fibers, improving their robustness. However, the large the radius the smaller the signal-to-background ratio. The detector active volume for $2~\mm$ fibers is smaller than for $1~\mm$ fibers and the internal volume of the fibers, unreachable by tritium decay electrons, is larger for $2~\mm$ fibers. As a result, a lower signal-to-background ratio and a larger background is obtained.

%On the one hand $1~\mm$ are better for the tritium detection since the mean free path of the tritium decay electrons inside the fiber is about $5~\mu\meter$. The part of the scintillating fiber deeper than that, larger for $2~\mm$ scintillating fibers will only contribute to the background of the prototype, masking the tritium signal. In addition, more $1~\mm$ fibers can be used in the same space, achieving a larger active area of the detector. Therefore, fewer photosensors are needed for the TRITIUM monitor, lowering its price. On the other hand $2~\mm$ improves the flow of the water through the scintillating fiber bunch, a crucial point since it is directly proportional to the active area of the prototype.

\item{} The whole surface-conditioning method consisting in cutting, polishing and cleaning methods, is applied to the scintillating fibers of the TRITIUM-IFIC-2 prototype but only the cutting method is applied to the scintillating fibers of the TRITIUM-Aveiro prototype.

\item{} The TRITIUM-Aveiro prototype use PMTs as photosensors. Although most of the development of TRITIUM-IFIC-2 was made with PMTs, the final purpose is to employ SiPM arrays that provides a larger photodetection efficiency than PMTs for a similar price. In addition, no high voltage is needed, which reduces the price of both prototype and electronics.

\item{} The TRITIUM-Aveiro prototype uses a home-made PCB-based electronics, which is cheaper than PETsys. However, the PETsys system is quite stable and meets the TRITIUM monitor scalability without any additional development.

\end{enumerate}

The development and operation of these two prototypes will indicate the best option for the final TRITIUM monitor.
