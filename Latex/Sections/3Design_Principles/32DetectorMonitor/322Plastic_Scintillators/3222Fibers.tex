Plastic scintillators are organic scintillators that has been disolved in a solven and polimerized. They are easy to machine and can take any desired shape during construction. Among the forms most used today we can find blocks, thin sheets, cylinders, etc.

The chosen shape for TRITIUM detector is the fiber, specifically, commercial fibers BCF-12 from Saint-Gobain Crystals Inc company \cite{DataSheetBCF12Fiber}. This type of fiber was chosen as the result of a comparative study \cite{TFGAlberto} among some of the best-known commercial manufacturers, such as Kuraray \cite{DataSheetKuraray}. 

%In our experiment we have been working with an plastic scintillator in the form of fiber, specifically, commercial fibers BCF-12 from Saint-Gobain Crystals Inc \cite{DataSheetBCF12Fiber}. This type of fiber was chosen as the result of a comparative study \cite{TFGAlberto} among some of the best-known commercial manufacturers, such as Kuraray \cite{DataSheetKuraray}. 

The BCF-12 fibers consist of a scintillated core, whose material is polystyrene, one of the most used solvents for plastic scintillators \cite{Knoll}, with the posibility of surounding it of a cladding of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) (smaller refractive index than core in order to archieve a critical angle) or a multicladding (second cladding) with even smaller refractive index.

When a particle deposits all or part of its kinetic energy, some photons are produced in the fiber core as a result of the scintillating process. The number of photons produced depend on the scintillation efficiency, whose value is around $2.4\%$ for the fibers used (BCF-12), which means that $8000$ photons will be produced per $\MeV$ for a mip (scintillation yield). For instance, for tritium electron, this fibers will release a maximum of around 148 photons (when tritium electron has the maximum energy, $18.6~\keV$), probably less because electrons with these energies are not mips.

These photons will shape the useful part of the response of the scintillator (fluorescence). The energy (or wavelength) of these scintillated photons follows the distribution of their emission spectrum which, for the used fibers, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:EmissionSpectrumFibers}.

\end{figure}

After the production of scintillated photons, these photons will be guided to the sensitive part of the photosensor where they will be detected with some probability. Fibers (and scintillators in general) use the optical property of Snell's law \cite{Snell} to guide their photons to the desired part (ends of the fibers). It is based on the interface created between the core and the surrounding material. When a photon hits this interface, it is refracted (and therefore lost) following the Snell equation, \ref{eq:Snell}. If the surrounding material has a lower refractive index than the core of the fiber, there exist a critical angle, $\theta_c$, at which, for angles equal or larger than this one, the photons will be totally reflected (and therefore conserved in the fiber for being guided). This effect is showed in Figure \ref{fig:Fiber_physic}.

\begin{equation}
n_0~sen(\theta_0) = n_1~sen(\theta_1) \longrightarrow \theta_c = asen\left(\frac{n_1}{n_0} \right)
\label{eq:Snell}
\end{equation}

There exist a parameter, called the trapping efficiency or photon collection efficiency, which define the efficiency of the scintillator to guide photons. For BCF-12 fibers with optical clad is between $3.44\%$ and $7\%$ per meter of fiber (depending if the event was detected near the fiber axis (minimum) or near the core-clad interface(maximum)) and for no clad fibers BCF-12 surrounded by water, it is a bit larger but presents some problems as it will be seen.

Therefore, from these $148$ photons initially created with the detection of the tritium electron with the maximum energy, only a maximum of around 41 photons (for maximum trapping efficiency) will be conserved in the $25~\cm$ fiber length used in the TRITIUM detector. As can be appreciated, the output signal is very weak and this is the range of the spectrum where there is the most electronic noise. As will be seen in future chapters, a great effort has been made to minimize this electronic noise with various techniques.

In Figure \ref{fig:Fiber_physic} we can see how a scintilalting fiber works.

\end{figure}

The cladding material is useful for protecting the core surface from dirt or aggressive external agents that can reduce the light collection but at the cost of losing some light because it increase the critical angle. Three different examples are shown in Table \ref{tab:CriticalAngles}, where this effect is ilustrated.

\begin{table}[htbp]

\hline \hline \hline

\end{tabular}

\label{tab:CriticalAngles}
\end{center}
\end{table}

In the practice, it's difficult to archieve a perfect air-core or water-core interface and it will affect to the light collection. Due to the reason that the commercial claddings are thicker ($30~\micro \meter$) than the mean free path of tritium in water ( around $5~\micro\meter$) commercial cladding is not an available option for TRITIUM detector. Hence we will need to take special attencion for archieving a water-core interface good enough. To overcome this problem, as we will see in section \ref{subsubsec:CleaningProcess}, we have used a special protocol developed in the ICMOL laboratories for preparing fibers before we use them for tritium detection.
