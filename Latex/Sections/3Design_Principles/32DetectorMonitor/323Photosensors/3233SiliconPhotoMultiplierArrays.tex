The Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM), also called Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC), is a kind of photosensor based on silicon, developed in the last two decades. SiPMs are replacing progresively conventional PMTs in many experiments and applications. They have outstanding photon counting capabilities at the single photon level with higher photodetection efficiency than PMTs and they have a similar gain. SiPMs have, in addition, several advantages as insensitiveness to magnetic fields, low operating voltage, compactness and ruggedness. The only drawback with respect to PMTs is their high dark count rate (between $100~\kilo\hertz$ and $1~\mega\hertz$).

SiPMs are formed by a matrix of Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) conected in parallel and operating in Geiger mode. APDs, shown in Figure \ref{fig:SchemeAPD}, are based on p-n junctions. %\footnote{A p-n junction is a junction of a p+ and n+ layer, which are a tetravalent material doped with a trivalent or pentavalent material respectively, creating sublevels in the forbidden energy gap.} made with special techniques to achieve a good contact between both surfaces.

\end{figure}
 The voltage at which a SiPM starts operating in Geiger mode is called the breakdown voltage, $V_ {BD}$. At lower voltages, SiPMs work in proportional mode in which the signal of each APD is proportional to the energy deposited but their gain is lower than in Geiger mode. The measurement of the $V_ {BD}$, described in section \ref{sec:CharacterizationSiPM}, is important to characterize a SiPM, since properties of SiPMs, as the gain, depend on the overvoltage, $V_{OV}$, that is the the SiPM bias voltage above $V_ {BD}$:

\begin{equation}
V_{bias}=V_{BD}+V_{OV}
\label{overvoltage}
\end{equation}
These APDs, called pixels when they are part of a SiPM, are connected in parallel to give the SiPM output signal. If the photon flux is low enough, each SiPM pixel detects at most one photon. All pixels give a similar output signal, regardless of the energy deposited. Therefore, the charge of the output signal when $n$ pixels are simultaneously fired is $n$ times the charge of a single pixel, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:PulsesOfSiPM}. Hence, the number of detected photons is linearly proportional to the integrated output signal. In addition, as the number of detected photons is porportional to the number of incident photons when a SiPM is working in the linear range, after the calibration of the SiPM output signal versus the number of incident photons, described in section \ref{sec:CharacterizationSiPM}, the energy of tritium events can be determined. If the photon flux is high (typically several thousands of photons per event) more than one photon would impinge on the same pixel. This effect, known as saturation, produces a loss of linearity of the output signal. However, this effect is negligible for the TRITIUM detector since tritium electrons produce few photons. %The experimental measurements of this effect, which have been done for our SiPMs, is shown in section \ref{sec:CharacterizationSiPM}.

\end{figure}

Different sizes of the SiPM pixel are available\footnote{Pixel sizes for commercial SiPMs are $25$, $50$ or $75\mu\meter$ \cite{DataSheetHammamatsu_1_SiPM_25, DataSheetHammamatsu_1_SiPM_50, DataSheetHammamatsu_1_SiPM_75}}. For a given SiPM active area, the smaller pixels allow, which implies a higher dynamic range, at the cost of reducing its quantum efficiency. As the tritium signals give few photons, the SiPMs chosen have the largest pixel size since we are well within the dynamic range and quantum efficiency is a critical parameter for tritium detection.

%The size of a SiPM pixel should be very small\footnote{Pixel sizes for commercial SiPMs are $25$, $50$ or $75\mu\meter$ \cite{DataSheetHammamatsu_1_SiPM_25}, \cite{DataSheetHammamatsu_1_SiPM_50}, \cite{DataSheetHammamatsu_1_SiPM_75}} to make sure that, for low enough photon fluxes, only one photon is detected in each pixel.

SiPM can be modeled as an electric circuit, shown in figure \ref{subfig:ElectricModelSiPM}. The depletion zone is represented by a capacitance, $C_d$. When a photon impignes on the pixel, the capacitor is discharged, creating an electronic pulse. Each pixel of a SiPM has a quenching resistance\footnote{The tipical value of this quenching resistance for commercial SiPMs is around $500~\kilo\Omega$} in series, $R_q$, that limits the avalanche current produced when this pixel is fired. When the discharge is produced, a current flows through the resistance, reducing the reverse voltage seen by the diode below the breakdown voltage. Then, the current through the diode vanishes and the bias voltage is reset. This pixel is ready to detect a new photon. This behaviour is schematically shown in Figure \ref{subfig:HowSiPMworks}. The voltage after photon detection is characteristic of a RC circuit, described by the equation: 

\begin{equation}
V(t)=V_{bias}\left(1-e^{-t/\tau} \right)
\label{RCCircuitBiasVoltage}
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is the recovery time constant of the system, given by $\tau=C_d \cdot{} R_q$. In section \ref{sec:CharacterizationSiPM} the capacitance $C_d$ and the quenching resistance $R_q$ are measured to obtain the recovery time constant extrapolated from both.

The SiPM gain (typically of the order of $10^6$) is defined as the number of e-h pairs produced when a pixel is fired. This can be measured from the SiPM single photon spectrum (SPS), which is the spectrum obtained when the SiPM output signal is integrated. The measurement of the SPS and the calculation of the gain is presented in section \ref{sec:CharacterizationSiPM}. It has to be taken into account that the SiPM gain is highly dependent on temperature, which cannot be controlled to less than $1\celsius$ in the final location of the TRITIUM monitor. Therefore, a gain stabilization method was implemented to compensate for temperature changes. This method is detailed in section \ref{sec:CharacterizationSiPM}.

An important parameter for SiPMs is the photon detection efficiency (PDE), defined as the probability of recording the electrical pulse produced by a photon that hits the SiPM. The PDE of a SiPM depends on three different paramenters: the fill factor ($FF$), which is the ratio between the active area of the SiPM and its total area, the quantum efficiency ($QE$), which is the probability of producing a photoelectron when a photon hits the SiPM and the probability, $P_{av}$, that an avalanche is produced. Thus, 

\begin{equation}
PDE=FF \times QE \times P_{av}
\label{PDE_SiPM}
\end{equation}

Likewise PMTs, SiPMs may produce dark current that depends on temperature. The dark current signal is identical to that of a single photon, so it cannot be discriminated. Therefore, it is essential to determine the magnitude of the dark current in the TRITIUM detector.

Avalanche electrons in a pixel can emit secondary optical photons\footnote{Around 20 secondary optical photons are emitted in each pixel for gains of the order of $10^6$ \cite{CrosstalkProbability}}. These optical photons can reach other pixels, producing new avalanches. This effect, called optical cross-talk, produces photoelectrons that add to those truly induced by incident photons, and hence leads to an overestimation of the number of photons detected. The probability of producing an optical crosstalk event depends on the number of electrons produced in the avalanche (gain) and, therefore, on temperature and overvoltage. This probability at the overvoltage recommended at $25\celsius$ by the manufacturer is typically less than $10\%$.

%The PDE, dark count rate and crosstalk are not measured yet since a different setup, shown in reference \cite{PDEStudy}, is needed. These parameters will be measured for the SiPM model used in the final version of TRITIUM monitor.

Due to imperfections existing in the cristal lattice of a SiPM, called traps, an electron of an avalanche can be captured and released after a characteristic time, $\tau_a$. If this characteristic time is longer than the pixel recovery time, typically $3\tau$, this electron can trigger a new avalanche which will be seen as a new event. These events, called  afterpulses, are often emitted around $1~\mu\second$ after the incident photon pulses. The afterpulse probability was not measured since it is not relevant for the TRITIUM project because the TRITIUM detector makes time coincidences using $10~\nano\second$ time windows. The afterpulse probability is thus negligible since it happens about $1~\mu\second$ after the SiPM output pulse.

The initial SiPM candidate for the TRITIUM project and the one which was characterized is the model S13360-1375 from Hamamatsu Photonics \cite{DataSheetHammamatsu_1_SiPM_1375} because its properties, given in Table \ref{tab:PropertiesOfSiPM1375}. This model was mainly chosen due to its large pixel size, $75~\mu\meter$, which implies high PDE and gain, both important for the TRITIUM project due to the low activities to be detected and to the smallness of tritium signals. %High PDE and high gain are achieved at the cost of reducing the dinamic range, which is not an issue due to the small photon signals expected from tritium events in the scintillating fibers.

The parameters quoted in Table \ref{tab:PropertiesOfSiPM1375}, are typical values provided by the manufacturer, Hamamatsu Photonics. They can vary from one SiPM to another of the same model. Thus, it is necessary to measure them. Some of these measurements are reported in section \ref{sec:CharacterizationSiPM}.  This SiPM was also chosen because, as it can be observed in Figure \ref{fig:PDESiPM}, its maximum PDE is reached at $\lambda_{p,SiPM}=450~\nano\meter$, which is very close to the peak of the emission spectrum of the scintillating fibers used, $\lambda_{p,fiber}=435~\nano\meter$.

\end{figure}
This SiPM was later replaced by the model S13360-6075 from Hamamatsu Photonics \cite{DataSheetHammamatsu_1_SiPM_75}, the properties of which are also listed in Table \ref{tab:PropertiesOfSiPM1375}. The only difference between this model and the first is its larger active area ($6\times6~\mm^2$), which is the largest active area of commercial SiPMs of Hamamatsu, that allows to read more scintillating fibers. This improvement is achieved at the price of a higher dark count rate (typically 2 Mcps). %Finally, arrays of this SiPM model are commercially available and were chosen for the TRITIUM detector prototypes built at IFIC.

Although TRITIUM detector uses SiPM arrays, the caracterization has been carried out at the level of a single SiPM to learn about the values of the SiPM parameters and to test the gain control method. %A new experimental setup, detailed in appendix \ref{App:ElectronicReadoutSiPM}, is already  prepared to perform a complete characterization of the SiPM model S13360-6075.
