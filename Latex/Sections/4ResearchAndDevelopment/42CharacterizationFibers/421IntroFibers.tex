Measurements of the plastic scintillating fiber parameters relevant for tritium detection, such as of collection efficiency and systematic uncertainty of the measured tritium activity are reported in this section. The TRITIUM detector is composed of thousands of scintillating fibers which have to be prepared and conditioned. Various mechanical and electronic devices were developed to automatically prepare a large number of fibers simultaneously.
