A third test was carried out to check the effect of the fiber diameter in the tritium measurement. For this test, the same simulation explained in section \ref{subsec:FiberLengthSimulation} was used, where a fiber length of $20~\cm$ was choseen. Two different diameters were taken into account in this study, $1~\mm$ and $2~\mm$, which are the commercial options given by Saint-Gobain company.

It doesn't have sense to test it with the tritium source since its efficiency will scale with the active surface\footnote{The active surface of the scintillating fiber is the part of the surface of the scintillating fiber that is in contact with the tritiated water.} of the scintillating fiber. However, an interesting study can be performed to check how the fiber diameter affect to the cosmic detection in the fiber. It is an important result as the background-signal ratio is mainly affected by the cosmic events that hit the Tritium detector.

To do so, the CRY library\footnote{CRY library, Cosmic-Ray Shower library} \cite{CRYwebsite}, \cite{CRYpaper} was used to generate this cosmic events, which remplaced the tritiated water source used in the previous simulation. The CRY library is able to generate cosmic-ray shower distributions for different particles (muons, neutrons, protons, electrons, photons and pions) at several heights (see level in our case).

The cosmic sources shape used in this simulation is a square of $1\cdot 1~\meter ^2$ located at a height of $35~\cm$.

The result of this simulation will be shown in section \ref{sec:ResultsSimulations}, where it will be discussed.
