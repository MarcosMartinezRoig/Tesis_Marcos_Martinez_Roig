The electronic system is in charge of reading, processing and analyzing the output signal of photosensors and providing output information about the tritium detection. This electronic system depends on the type of detector configurations employed

%In each type of detector configuration, this electronic system will also be different depending on the type of information we want to obtain. For example, it will be different if we want to obtain an energy spectrum as output information or simply a number such as the number of counts per second of our detector or the output electrical current. Each electron system that has been used in our experiment will be explained during this section.
