The scintillation yield provided by the manufacturer, $8000~\text{phot.}/\MeV$ only works for Minimum Ionizing Particles (MIP). As tritium electron energies are far from being MIP particles, the output light generated by the scintillating fibers was studied. 

A correction, called the Birks coefficient ($k_B$), caused by the light quenching is considered to the proporcionality between the output light per unit of apth length, $\frac{dL}{dx}$, and the energy deposited per unit of path length $\frac{dE}{dx}$\cite{BirksPaper}.

\begin{equation}
\frac{dL}{dx}= S\frac{\frac{dE}{dx}}{1+k_B\frac{dE}{dx}}
\label{eq:birkscoefficient}
\end{equation}

where the S is the scintillation yield, provided by the manufacturer. A value of $k_B=0.126~\mm/MeV$ was considered for the Birk's coefficient which is the one used for scintillators based on polystyrene \cite{BirksCoefficient}. The effect of this correction is shown and discussed in section \ref{subsec:ResultsOutputLight}.
