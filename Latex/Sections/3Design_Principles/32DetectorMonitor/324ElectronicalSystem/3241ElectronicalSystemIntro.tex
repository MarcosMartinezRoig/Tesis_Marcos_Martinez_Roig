The last part needed to have a complete scintillator detector is the electronic system. This is the part in charge of reading, processing and analyzing the output signal of the used photosensor and providing useful information.

This electronic system will depends on the type of the output signal of the detector, which means that it will be different for the different detector configurations tested,  PMT and SiPMs.

%In each type of detector configuration, this electronic system will also be different depending on the type of information we want to obtain. For example, it will be different if we want to obtain an energy spectrum as output information or simply a number such as the number of counts per second of our detector or the output electrical current. Each electron system that has been used in our experiment will be explained during this section.
