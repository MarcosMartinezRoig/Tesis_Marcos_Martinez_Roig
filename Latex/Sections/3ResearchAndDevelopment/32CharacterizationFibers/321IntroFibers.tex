In this section we will make experimental measurements of the scintillating fiber parameters that most affect the tritium detection, such as its collection effficiency or their uncertainty in its conditioning process.

We have to take into account that we are working with thousands of scintillating fibers that need to be prepared and conditioned prior to use in fiber studies or inside of TRITIUM monitor. Therefore, as we will see in this section, we had to develop machines that are able to automatically prepare so many fibers at the same time.
