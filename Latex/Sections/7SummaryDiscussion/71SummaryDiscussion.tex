In this chapter, the most important results obtained in this PhD work are summarized and extensively discussed. These results are classified into three different groups which correspond to the results obtained during the R\&D tasks of the TRITIUM monitor (chapter \ref{chap:ResearchandDevelopment}), the results obtained with each TRITIUM prototype developed (chapter \ref{chap:Prototypes}) and the results of the TRITIUM simulations (chapter \ref{chap:Simulations}).

During the Reserch \& Development tasks, the components of the TRITIUM monitor and its design was optimized, which consist on the TRITIUM module and its internal parts (scintillating fibers, photosensors, etc), the background rejection shield and the ultrapure water system. 

\begin{itemize}
\item{} A surface-conditioning method for the scintillating fibers, which consists in cutting, polishing and cleaning tasks following specific steps, was developed. In addition, a polishing machine, based on arduino technology, was developed, which is capable of polishing hunderds of fibers automatically. The objective of this machine was to automate the task of manual polishing fibers, unattainable for the amount of fibers needed in the TRITIUM monitor. The surface-conditioning method was tested, achieving an increasement of the light collected by the fiber of a factor 2 for the polishing task and $25\%$ for the cleaning task. Furthermore, a characterization of the uncladded scintillating fibers was carried out, in which its photon colleciton efficiency and the increasment of its uncertainty due to the surface-conditioning method was quantified. The photon collection efficiency obtained for the uncladded scintillating fibers is $76\pm 8\%$ which is slightly smaller than that expected by the manufacturer ($96\%$). The uncertainty measured for the photon collection efficiency after applying the surface-conditioning method on uncladded scintillating fibers, $2.86\%$, is small enough to be acceptable.

A characterization of the SiPM model S13360-6075 from Hamamatsu was carried out at the level of a single SiPM. In this characterization, some of the most relevant parameters of the SiPM for the detection of tritium, such as internal gain of SiPM, breakdown voltage, temperature coefficient and others like quenching resistance, terminal capacitance, were experimentally measured and compared with the manufacturer. A very good precision was achieved in this study, obtaining small uncertainties in the SPS spectrum (about $1\%$ for each photopeak) and a very good agreement with the values expected by the manufacturer.

%An additional calibration was carried out at the level of a SiPM matrix in which the probability of crosstalk between different SiPMs was measured, obtaining an insignificant probability of happening. The linearity of the SiPM signal as a function of the the number of scintillating fibers was also verified.

Due to the strong dependence of SiPM internal gain on temperature, a stabilization method for SiPM gain was implemented in the temperature range of interest, $[20-30]~\celsius$ . The objective of this mechanism is to compensate for temperature variations with variations in the SiPM's operating voltage, maintaining the SiPM's internal gain during its operation. This stabilization method was tested experimentally, obtaining variations of $0.1\%$ in the SiPM gain, which can be considered negligibles.

\item{} The background rejection system is divided into active and passive veto. On the one hand, a passive shield, which consists of a lead castle with walls of $5~\cm$ width, was designed by the TRITIUM collages of France and installed in Arrocampo. This passive shield is aimed to reduce the environmental background that affects to the tritium measurement. This reduction was proved throguh simulations obtianing a reduction of a factor $5.5$. On the other hand, an active veto was built and tested, which consists of two scintillating plastic separated $34.2~\cm$, each one read out by two photosensors. The scintillating plastic was wrapped with a PTFE layer, an aluminium layer and black tape layer, which improved the light collection and the spatial uniformity of the signal along different points on the plastic scintillator. In addition, the experimental conditions that optimize the detection of the hard cosmic events, such as thresholds and high voltage, was found. A hard cosmic rate of $2.5~\text{eventts}/\text{s}$ was experimentally found, which gives an efficiency of the cosmic veto of $85\%$. Furthermore, the energy spectrum measured fits very well with the expected Laudau function. Finally the dependence of the hard cosmic rate on the distance between both scintillating plastics was studied and quantified, allowing this distance to be changed without the need to perform a new calibration of the active veto.

\item{} Regarding the water purification system, the TRITIUM collages of Extremadura carried out a detailed analisys of the water of Arrocampo, where the samples will be taken. Due to the presence of the high concentrations of chemical components in this sample, a water purification system was needed. A water purification system was designed and installed in Arrocampo dam and its level of the purification was tested. Conductivities about $10~\mu\text{S}/\cm$ (two orders less than the initial sample) were achieved. Furthermore, the tritium activity in the sample was found to remains unchanged after the process of purification.

\end{itemize}

Important results were obtained through simulations, which were implemented in the built prototypes. It was seen that the efficiency of tritium detection in the prototypes is larger when short fibers (about $20~\cm$) are used insted of long fibers ($1~\meter$). An improvement of a factor $5$ is acheived in the tritium count rate measured.

Four different prototypes was developed by the TRITIUM project, called TRITIUM-IFIC-0, TRITIUM-IFIC-1, TRITIUM-Aveiro and TRITIUM-IFIC-2, listed in chronological order of its construction. The first two prototypes, TRITIUM-IFIC-0 and TRITIUM-IFIC-1, was used to detect potential problems that affect to the tritium measurement as well as to test several improvement in the detector design. The last two prototypes, TRITIUM-Aveiro and TRITIUM-IFIC-2, are two slightly different designs in which smaller tritium activities was used to optimize the tritium measurement, specifically its tritium detection efficiency and its minimum detectable activity, MDA. Each design has its own advantages and disadvantages and the characteristics of each one with the best results will be implemented in the final design of the TRITIUM module.

\begin{itemize}

\item{} In the first prototypes, the use of a straight arrangament of the scintillating fibers was found to be a critical points for the tritium detection. In addition, a surface-conditioning method was succesfully implemented in the scintillating fiber, obtaining an improvement in the tritium detection. The use of a PTFE vessel was also found to improve the light collection in the TRITIUM prototypes. Finally, the use of two photosensors in coincidence time mode was needed to improve the minimum detectable activity, MDA, of the prototype.

\item{} The lastest prototypes are based in a similar design but with subtle difference. One of the most important difference is the use a different diameter for the scintillating fibers ($2~\mm$ for the TRITIU-Aveiro prototype and $1~\mm$ for the TRITIUM-IFIC-2 prototype). The use of $1~\mm$ fibers allows to arrange more scintillating fibers in the same space, increasing the total active area of the prototype (and, therefore, its efficiency to the tritium detection) and the signal-to-background ratio (and, therefore, improving its MDA). The use of $2~\mm$ fibers may facilitate the flow of the water through the fiber bunch, increasing its active area. In addition, $2~\mm$ fibers are more resistance which could be important if higher water fluxes are used. It was observed through a simulation that the cosmic rate in the energy region of interest of tritium is higher for scintillating fibers of $2~\mm$. Additional experimental tests need to be done to take a final decision.

Another important difference is the photosensor purposed. TRITIUM-Aveiro use PMTs as photosensors and, although the study shown in this work for the TIRITIUM-IFIC-2 was done with PMTs, its final purpose is the use of SiPM arrays. SiPM arrays have some advantages such as a higher photodetection efficiency, which increase the tritium detection efficiency of the detector, or no need to use high voltage, reduciing the price of the TRITIUM monitor. However it has some disadvantages such as it is needed to read out more channels, which complicates the electronic system used.

A better specific efficiency was obtained with the TRITIUM-IFIC-2 prototype. The reason for this is supposed to be mainly due to the surface-conditioning method, which was applied to the scintillating fibers contained in the TRITIUM-IFIC-2 prototype. In addition, a lower MDA was found for the TRITIUM-IFIC-2 prototype, $677~\becquerel/\liter$ for an integration time of $10~\min$ or $218~\becquerel/\liter$ for an integration time of $1~\hour$. This allows to effectively distinguish lower tritium activities from the background than in the TRITIUM-Aveiro prototype.

A summary of the State-Of-The-Art of the tritium detection is shown in Figure \ref{tab:ComparisonResultsTritium}, which includes the results obtained with the four different prototypes developed in the TRITIUM project. As it can be seen, the TRITIUM-IFIC 2 prototype overcome the current State-of-the-Art, obtaining a specific efficiency and MDA better that the best result obtianed in other experiemnts (Hofstetter), almost an order of magnitud better in both parameters. As it can be seen, the specific efficiency obtained for the TRITIUM-Aveiro prototype is smaller than the expected. The most probably reason is that the used fibers was not polished nor cleaned, reducing the tritium events detected. The choose which fibers are the best choice for the tritium detection, $1~\mm$ or $2~\mm$ diameter, it would be appropriate to build a TRITIUM-Aveiro prototype in which, the surface-conditioning method is applied to the scintillating fibers.

Finally, although the minimum detectable activity achieved with this prototype does not meet the TRITIUM project goal of $100~\becquerel/\liter$, it is only achieved with one module. One of the most important property of the TRITIUM monitor is that it is scalable, which means that better results can be achieved by using a larger number of modules. The MDA of the TRITIUM monitor is expected to be reduced by a factor $\sqrt{\text{Number of modules}}$ respect to the MDA obtained with one module. Therefore, an MDA of  $100~\becquerel/\liter$ could be achieved using 5 modules in parallel when an integration time of $1~\hour$ is used. Furthermore, the MDA reported in this PhD work was measured without the installation of the background rejection system. The MDA of these TRITIUM prototypes are expected to improve when the background rejection system is included.

In addition, the stability of the tritium detection efficiency of the latest TRITIUM prototypes was verified for several months, without obtaining any decrease of tritium counts during this time.

Finally, several simulations were carried out to study how the tritium detection efficiency of the TRITIUM-IFIC-2 prototype and the measurement resolution can be improved when different integration times and number of prototypes are used. These simulations, which agree with the experimental measurements obtained with this prototype, allow us to make the decision to use three different modules read in parallel with an integration time of $30~\min$. With this choice, a difference of $250~\becquerel/\liter$ in tritium concentration is expected to be measured.

Currently, the lead shielding, the water purification system and a TRITIUM-Aveiro prototype are installed in Arrocampo dam. Two additional TRITIUM-Aveiro prototypes and an active veto are planed to be installed as soon as possible. Furthermore, three TRITIUM-IFIC-2 prototypes and an active veto are ready to be installed too, the instalation of which was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.
