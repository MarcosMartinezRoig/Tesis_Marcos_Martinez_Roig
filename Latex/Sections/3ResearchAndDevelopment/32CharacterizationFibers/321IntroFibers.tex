In this section we will try to measure experimentally the parameters of scintillating fibers that most affect the detection of tritium, such as their uncertainty in its preparation and conditioning process or the uncertaint in its light collection efficiency.

We have to take into account that we are working with thousands of scintillating fibers that need to be prepared and conditioned prior to use in fiber studies or inside of TRITIUM monitor. Therefore, as we will see in this section, we had to develop machines to be able to prepare many fibers at the same time and automatically.
