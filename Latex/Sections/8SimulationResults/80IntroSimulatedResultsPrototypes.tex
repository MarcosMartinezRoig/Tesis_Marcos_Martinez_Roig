This chapter shows the results obtained in the simulations described in chapter \ref{chap:Simulations}. This is divided in two different sections. The first one presents the results of several simulations used to improve the design of the TRITIUM detector while the second exhibits the results obtianed for the simulation of a full TRITIUM monitor based on several TRITIUM-IFIC 2 prototypes. As it is shown in various sections of this chapter, several tests are carried out to verify the correct simulation of the different steps such as the simulated tritium source, the energy deposition in the fibers and the production of photons in them.
