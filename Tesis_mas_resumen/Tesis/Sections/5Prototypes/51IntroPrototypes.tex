The different prototypes developed in the framework of the TRITIUM project, their characterization and their measurements in the labortories and Arrocampo dam are described in this chapter. They are named TRITIUM-IFIC-0, TRITIUM-IFIC-1, TRITIUM-Aveiro and TRI-TIUM-IFIC-2, listed in chronological order of their construction. The first two prototypes, TRITIUM-IFIC-0 and TRITIUM-IFIC-1, were used to learn about in-water tritium detection and to define the monitor design. TRITIUM-Aveiro and TRITIUM-IFIC-2 have an optimized design based on the lessons learned from the former prototypes. These detectors were filled with tritiated water following a specific method and several water tightness and filling tests were carried out. At the end of the chapter, the final monitor design of the TRITIUM detector is described.
