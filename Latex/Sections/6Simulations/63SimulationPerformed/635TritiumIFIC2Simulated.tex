The Tritium-IFIC 2 prototype simulation was the last simulation developed in the TRITIUM experiment and it was the one I mainly focused on. This simulation is similar to the previous simulation of the Tritium-Aveiro 0 prototype simulation since the design of both detectors are quite similar. There are two main difference between both simulated prototypes:

\begin{enumerate}

\item{} The diameter of the fibers used, which is $1~\mm$ for Tritium-IFIC 2 prototype and $2~\mm$ for Tritium-Aveiro 0 prototype. As we are filling the internal volume of the teflon vessel, this difference imply a difference number of the used scintillating fibers, creating in a difference signal-background ratio.

\item{} The photosensors used since, although both are PMTs, the model of the used PMTs is different and it cause a different active area readout, affecting to the tritium detection efficiency. 

\end{enumerate}

The Tritium-IFIC 2 prototype simulation consists of $800$ equispaced fibers distributed in sixteen different circles with increasing radius, which are shown in Figure \ref{fig:FibersTritiumIFIC2Simulation}. The fibers simulated has a diammeter of $1~\mm$ and the optical properties, mentioned in section \ref{sec:Geant4Environment}, has been added to them, whose values has been obtained from the data sheet provided by the manufacturer.

The used tritium water source consists of a tritium water volume with a thickness of $5~\mu\meter$ around each scintillating fiber. The Tritium events will be uniformly distributed in all the tritium water volume. 

These scintillator fibers are located inside of a teflon vessel, which was simulated with the dimensions mentioned in section \ref{subsec:TritiumIFIC2}. Two PMMA windows with a thickness of $5~\mm$ were simulated and located in both fiber ends and a optical grease layer with a thickness of $0.5~\mm$ was included in each PMMA windows.

Finally, two PMTs, model R8520-460 from Hamamatsu company \cite{DataSheetPMTs}, were simulated in both ends. The data for the dimensions of them and their quantum efficiency spectrum were obtained from the data sheet provided by the manufacturer.

The optical properties used for the tritium water, teflon vessel, PMMA windows and the optical grease are exactly the same as those used for the Tritium-Aveiro 0 prototype simulation.

This simulation is shown in Figure \ref{fig:TritiumIFIC2Simulation} in which can be appreciated the PMTs (black), the optical grease (blue), PMMA windows (white), tritium water (green) and scintillating fibers (yellow). In this image, the Teflon container was not drawn to allow its interior to be seen and several volumes of tritium water were also not included to allow several scintillation fibers to be seen.

As can be seen in this figure, the used PMTs don't cover the entire active area formed by the scintillating fiber bundle. It's not a problem for the Tritium detector since its final version will not include this photosensors. The final version of Tritium-IFIC 2 prototype will use SiPM arrays and the PMTs model used in the Tritium-Aveiro 0 prototype are circular PMTs with which the full active area is covered.
