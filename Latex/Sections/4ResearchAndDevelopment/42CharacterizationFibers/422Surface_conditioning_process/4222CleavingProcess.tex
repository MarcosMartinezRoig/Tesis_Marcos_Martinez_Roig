The first step in the TRITIUM design was to choose the fiber length and the fiber diameter ($1$ or $2~\mm$) for which the signal of tritium events is optimized. On the one hand, long fibers are suitable because fewer fibers are needed to achieve the same TRITIUM detector efficiency as with short fibers, reducing the cost of the TRITIUM detector. On the other hand, in long fibers scintillating photons are reflected on the fiber boundaries many times before reaching the photosensors, which may produce a deterioration in the tritium signal. To determine the optimal fiber length, several simulations, described in section \ref{subsec:FiberLengthSimulation}, were carried out using Geant4 \cite{Geant4WebPage}. It was concluded that the optimal fiber length for mesuring tritium in water is around $20~\cm$, which is the fiber length used in the TRITIUM prototypes developed at IFIC and for most of the characterization studies carried out. As Saint-Gobain deliver $1~\meter$ long fibers, an effective cleaving technique had to be developed with strict requirements on the cleaving quality of the fiber ends, since this greatly affects the transmission of photons and, consequently, the detection efficiency of the TRITIUM detector. The cleaving must be done perpendicular to the fiber axis and with small uncertainty in the cleaving position to enables optimal coupling to the photosensor. It is also important that the fiber integrity be preserved, without cracks or deformations that may contribute to the loss of photons. 

Cleaving plastic fibers is a current challenge. There are many different techniques such as milling, laser cleaving, focused-ion-beam, blade cleaving, etc. The blade cleaving technique was chosen for TRITIUM because of its mechanical simplicity and because it preserves the integrity of plastic fibers. Many commercial devices based on blade cleaving, such as the one provided by Thorlabs with a diamond tipped blade \cite{DiamondThorlabs}, or to guillotines designed for industrial fiber optics \cite{GuillotineIFO}, were tested in an extensive study with unsuccessful results \cite{TFGAlberto}. As it can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:BadCleavesOfFibers}, commercial techniques produce deformations, cracks and imperfections so they do not fulfill the quality standard required for the detector.

Because commercial devices are not suitable for polymer fibers, a cleaving device, shown in Figure \ref{fig:CleaveTRITIUMDevice}, was designed and built at IFIC laboratory.

This device consists of an aluminium plate endowed with fourteen grooves for lodging the fibers. A thin razor blade attached to a mobile piece is used to cleave the fibers. The perpendicular cleave, which is one of the requirements, can be ensured since the moving piece to which the blade is attached is placed perpendicular to the fiber axis. The blade used is a typical commercial razor blade, of $0.1~\mm$ thickness, which is the thickness that gave the best results. The blade was positioned with a $5\degree$ inclination with respect to the horizontal axis since it was found in several studies that this helps to obtain a less aggressive and cleaner cleave \cite{AngleBlade, TemperatureBlade}. As it can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:CleavingFiberEnd}, the integrity of the fiber is preserved and not deformed is present. It can be noticed some tears on the clad. Although it does not affect the tritium project since uncladded fibers are used, it was verified under microscope that this only occurs at the end of the fiber. It was verified in section \ref{subsubsec:CharacterizationFibers} that these tears on the fiber cladding affect negligibly the photon collection.

An additional parameter that could affect the cleaving quality of the fiber ends is the temperature of both fiber and blade. A study was carried out in which both were subject to different temperatures, from room temperature to $110\celsius$. No significant conclusions were obtained \cite{TFGAlberto}. Thus, the cleaving process was carried out at room temperature to make the cleaving process easier.

A second L-shaped aluminium plate with grooves was attached to the first one (see Figure \ref{fig:CleaveTRITIUMDevice}) to set accurately the length of the fibers to $200~\mm$, with an uncertainty of $\pm 1~\mm$.
