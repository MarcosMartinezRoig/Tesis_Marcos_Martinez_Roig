The tasks of cutting and polishing the fibers add a small dispersion in the response of each individual scintillating fiber. This, together with the intrinsic uncertainty of scintillating fibers, generates an uncertainty, $\sigma_{TM}$, which is the contribution of the fibers to the total uncertainty in the tritium activity measured by the TRITIUM monitor. The setup shown in Figure \ref{fig:SetUpFiberCharacterization} was used to measure this uncertainty, in which has to be taken into account that the position of the connectors that lock the fiber in the experimental setup produces an additional systematic uncertainty, $\sigma_{sys}$, in the measurement. Since both uncertainties are independent, the total systematic uncertainty is given by:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{t} = \sqrt{\sigma^2_{sys} + \sigma^2_{TM} }
\label{eq:TotalUncertaintyFiberCharacterization}
\end{equation}
The uncertainty due to the fiber position has to be quantified to extract $\sigma^2_{TM}$ from the total uncertainty. Two different experiments were designed, the first giving only the systematic uncertainty ($\sigma_{t} = \sigma_{sys}$), and the second to obtain the total uncertainty. Then, $\sigma^2_{TM}$ is given by,

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{TM} = \sqrt{\sigma^2_{t} - \sigma^2_{sys} }
\label{eq:TMUncertaintyFiberCharacterization}
\end{equation}
The test designed to measure $\sigma_{sys}$ consisted of preparing one fiber of each type (uncladded, single clad and multiclad) using the conditioning process reported in section \ref{subsec:SurfaceConditioningProcess}. Each fiber was locked in the setup, and measurements by feeding the LED with an intensity of $0.1~\milli\ampere$  are made. These measurements were repeated ten times with a given fiber, removing and putting the fiber each time. The mean, $\bar{x}$, and the standard deviation of the PMT current for each fiber type are shown in Table \ref{tab:PositionStandardDeviation} where the relative standard deviation, $\sigma^{rel}_{pos}$, defined by equation \ref{eq:RelativeStandardDesviation}, is also included.

\begin{equation}
\sigma^{rel}_{sys} = \frac{\sigma_{sys}}{\bar{x}}
\label{eq:RelativeStandardDesviation}
\end{equation}

%As it can be noticed, the clad reduces the position uncertainty, which means that it improves the uniformity of the fiber response. It was also found that 
As it can be noticed, the clad significantly improves the light collection efficiency of the fibers, showing larger signals for single clad fibers and multiclad fibers than for uncladded fibers. The reason could be that photons are mainly collected in the core of the fiber and the interface of core better controlled for single-clad and multi-clad fibers than for uncladded fibers, where the interface is provided by the environment (air or water in the case of TRITIUM). External conditions, as dirt, may produce noticeable interface fluctuations. It is also seen in the table that a second clad slightly reduce the collection efficienciy. The reason could be that a second clad layer reduces the radious of the fiber core proportionally. Concerning the statistic error of the measurement, it is three orders of magnitude smaller than the systematic uncertainty of the measurement so it was negligible.

%In addition to the $\sigma_{pos}$ measurement, we have measured the number of photons collected by each type of fiber in the same situation, which is higher for single clad and even higher for multiclad. It means that the clad has an appreciable effect on the fiber collection efficiency and it could be a possible point to futur studies.

To determinate the total uncertainty, ten different samples of each fiber type were prepared and each fiber was measured under the same conditions as above. This measurement was done for four different LED emission intensities ($0.05$, $0.1$, $0.15$ and $0.2~\milli\ampere$). The results for uncladded fibers are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:10samplesNC}, where it can be seen that, although each fiber shows a very linear trend with increasing LED emission intensity, a dispersion in the fiber response is clearly observed. Similar results were obtained for single clad and multiclad fibers, displayed in figures \ref{subfig:10samplesSC} and \ref{subfig:10samplesMC}, respectively.

As it can be noticed in Figures \ref{fig:10samplesNC} and \ref{fig:10samplesThreeTypes} the fiber response is quite linear and single clad and multiclad fibers have stronger signals that uncladded fibers, which means that the clad has a significant effect on the fiber collection efficiency. It can also remarked in Table \ref{tab:RelativeStandardDeviation3FiberTypes} that the relative standard deviation, $\sigma^{rel}_{sys}$, does not vary with the LED intensity. The lowest uncertainty was reported for the uncoated fibers since, as we see in Figure \ref{subfig:PolishFiberEnd}, the cleaving task slightly damages the clad of the fiber. As can be seen, this damage is reduced when a second clad is used, which enhance the mechanical resistance of the fiber.

%The relative standard deviation are also presented in these tables, where we it can be seen that the dispersion of each fiber type for different LED intensities is practically negligible, which again verifies the correct behavior of the system. 

%There is only one point (uncladded fiber with $0.1~\milli\ampere $) that is higher than we expect. We can see in Table \ref{tab:10DifferentSamplesNoClad} that the reason for this is that its standard deviation is too high (as high as the measurement for uncladded fibers with $0.15~\milli\ampere$). The reason was found in the sample 9, whose measurement was very different from the average, incresing the standard deviation, probably due to a problem in the measurement process. We discard this sample because this result is not representative.

An average of the three relative standard deviation quoted in this section, $\sigma^{rel}_{t}$, $\sigma^{rel}_{sys}$ and $\sigma^{rel}_{TM}$,  are given in Table \ref{tab:RelativeStandardDeviations}. As it can be noticed, the smallest relative standard deviation in the tritium measurement was found for uncladded fibers, which means that the damage from this process occurs mainly in the fiber clad, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:ResultofPolishingProcess} where it can seen the clad break due to the cleaving process. It was checked under microscope that this damage only occurs at the end of the fiber. Also, the largest relative standard deviation in the tritium measurement is obtianed for single clad fibers, which means that the second clad increases the resistance of the fiber to the conditioning process.

In summary, this study shows that the use of a fiber clad improves the photon collection efficiency. The relative statistical deviation due to the fiber conditioning process was quantified for the different fiber types. It was found that the damage by the cleaving process is produced mainly in the fiber clad. %Thus, if a method to build a clad for fibers is developed, it should be applied after the fiber conditioning process.

Finally, the measurement of the absolute photon collection efficiency for each type of fiber is shown. To measure it, $CE_{100}$, ten different samples $10~\cm$ length were prepared for each fiber type and similar measurements, summarized in Table \ref{tab:10DifferentSamplesAlltypes}, were carried out.

\end{table}
The collection efficiency of $10~\cm$ fiber length, $CE_{10}$, was calculated by comparing these tests to those performed for a fiber length of $20~\cm$. The collection efficiency  to $CE_{100}$ was calculated from $CE_{10}$ by assuming a linear dependence on length.

\end{table}
The collection efficiency, $CE_{100}$, given by the manufacturer Saint-Gobain is in the range $3.44\%-7\%$ \cite{DataSheetBCF12Fiber}. Our measurements, given in Table \ref{tab:CollectionEfficiencyOfFibers}, are close but slightly higher than the manufacturer values which could be attributed to our use of collimated photons.

%As collimated photons were used in this study, the fact that our results are in the best side is justified. As it can be seen in Table \ref{tab:CollectionEfficiencyOfFibers}, our measured values are very close to those provided by the manufacturer. %The difference between this value for the three types of fiber studied is not as large as it was expected. A possible reason is that the difference in fiber length is only $10~\cm$ and it may not be enough to see this effect. It could be interesting to repeat these tests with a larger difference in fiber length.
