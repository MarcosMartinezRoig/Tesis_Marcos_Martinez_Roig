A similar test was performed to find the fiber length which optimizes the tritium detection efficiency. Two different lengths of the scintillating fiber were taked into account in this study, $1~\meter$ and $25~\cm$. 

For this task, the previous simulation was used in which optical properties, previously mentioned, were given to the fiber and two photosensors will be placed at both ends of the scintillating fiber at which only sensitive properties were given (energy deposition).  

The results of this study are shown in the section \ref{sec:ResultsSimulations} where they will be discussed.
