Weak radiationis suppresed by a lead shielding inside which the TRITIUM detector is placed. This lead shielding is effective for particle energies below $200~\MeV/$nucleon, which is due to the Earth's natural radioactivity and to the weak component of cosmic radiation. This lead shielding consists of $158$ lead bricks with ultra-low intrinsic radioactivity, $25~\mm$ thick. They are shevron shaped, shown in Figure \ref{subfig:LeadBricks}, specially designed for a perfect fit and easy assembly. As can be seen in Figures \ref{subfig:TwoLayers} and \ref{subfig:TwoLayers2}, these lead bricks are arranged in two layers to a total thickness of $50~\mm$. The junction of the inner layer lead bricks is shielded by a lead brick of the outer layer to avoid any leak of radiation.

Special aluminum structure was designed by mechanical engineering department of CENBG, shown in Figure \ref{fig:AluminiumStructure}, to support the total weight of the lead bricks, $2.4$ tons.

The internal room of the lead shielding is divided in two parts, as exhibited in Figure \ref{fig:LeadBricksAndArrangement}. The larger one has internal dimensions of $90.5 \cdot{} 41 \cdot{} 51~\cm^3$ and is used to place the TRITIUM detector. The smaller one, of dimensions of $33 \cdot{} 41 \dot{} 51~\cm^3$, contains the DAQ system. The external dimensions of the lead shielding are $148 \cdot{} 60 \cdot{} 70~\cm^3$ and a weighs $2.5$ tons.
