This section details the characterization of the SiPM S13360-1375 model, which was the first choosen as TRITIUM monitor photosensor. This characterization is incomplete since some important SiPM parameters for the TRITIUM monitor, which are PDE, dark count rate and crosstalk probability, were not measured. A complete characterization is already underway for the S13360-6075 model, the latest proposal for the TRITIUM detector, where the relevant parameters, given in section \ref{subsubsec:SiPM}, will be experimentaly determined using the experimental setup, described in appendix \ref{App:ElectronicReadoutSiPM}. The SiPM characterization is carried out inside of a climatic chamber, model CCM 81 from DYCOMETAL \cite{ClimaticChamberIFIMED}. This climatic chamber allows to control the temperature and humidity with a precisión of $0.1\celsius$ and $0.1\%$ respectively. In addition, this chamber is a Faraday cage. A special black blanket \cite{BlackBlancket} was used to prevent external photons from reaching the SiPM.

First, the quenching resistance and the breakdown voltage of the SiPM were obtained from the measurement of the current-voltage curves of the SiPM with the bias voltage applied in forward and reverse direction, respectively. This measurement was done without the amplification of the electronic board to achieve a better precision in the dark. The output current of the SiPM was directly measured using the Keithley 6487 Picoammeter/Voltage Source \cite{DataSheetKeithley6487}. The LabView sofware was used to take the data. The measured parameters are plotted as a function of the bias voltage in Figure \ref{fig:IVcurveSiPM}.

 \label{fig:IVcurveSiPM}
\end{figure}

As can be seen, when the bias voltage is applied in forward direction, Figure \ref{subfig:IVcurveForward}, the output current of the SiPM does not flow until the potential difference between the n and p layers is reached, which is approximately $V_0=0.7~\volt$ for silicon photosensors, close to the value experimentally obtained, $V_0= 0.5~\volt$. When the current start to flow, the intensity is linear with the applied voltage. The equivalent resistance, $R_{eq}$, was determined from, 
\begin{equation}
I=\frac{1}{R_{eq}}V;  \qquad \frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{1}{R_{qi}}= \frac{N}{R_{q}}
\label{QuenchingResistance}
\end{equation}
and $R_{iq}$ are the quenching resistance of each pixel of the SiPM in parallel which have the same value, $R_{q}$. A value of $R_{q}= 511.39 \pm 0.74~\kilo\ohm$ was obtained, which is in agreement with the typical values given by Hamamatsu.

The breakdown voltage, $V_{BD}$, was obtained from the reverse bias voltage plot. This is the points at which the output current of SiPM start to flow, which can be calculated from the maximum of the function 
\begin{equation}
f=\frac{1}{I}\frac{dI}{dV}
\label{BreakDownVoltageFunction}
\end{equation}

The value obtained, $V_{BD}=51.02~\volt$, is in agreement with the value provided by Hamamatsu, Table \ref{tab:PropertiesOfSiPM1375}.

To measure the SiPM gain, $G_{SiPM}$, the electronic board described in section \ref{subsubsec:SiPMsElectronicalSystem} with an amplification factor of $F_{amp}=170$ was used. An incoherent light source, LED435-03 from Toithner LaserTechnik Gmbh \cite{LEDRLT}, described in section \ref{subsec:CharacterizationFibers}, was used to illuminate the SiPM with a low enough flux of $\lambda= 435~\nm$ photons. The SiPM output signal shows various well-defined pulse heights, shown in Figure \ref{fig:OutputPulses_SPSspectrum}, corresponding to the number of pixels simultaneously fired. The single photon spectrum, SPS is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:OutputPulses_SPSspectrum}. This spectrum was obtained by integrating and hitogramming the SiPM output pulses with time windows wide enough to contain the full charge of the pulse. The time windows used in these measurements was $t_w= 500~\nano\second$. The light source gave a trigger signal for the measurement, green line in Fig \ref{fig:OutputPulses_SPSspectrum}.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]

\end{figure}

The well-separated peaks in the SPS spectrum correspond to the charge produced by a different number of fired pixels. The first peak in the spectrum is the pedestal, which is the charge measured when no pixel is fired. This peak is caused by the electronic noise of the system. The second peak corresponds to one fired pixel and so on. The SiPM gain, $G_{SiPM}$, can be obtained from the SPS spectrum from the equation,
\begin{equation}
G=\frac{\overline{\Delta Q}(V \cdot{} s)}{F_{amp}(V/A) \times e^-(C)}
\label{SiPMGain}
\end{equation}
where $e^-$ is the electron charge and $\overline{\Delta Q}$ is the average peak distance in the SPS spectrum, corresponding to the charge released by a fired pixel. 

To obtain the value of $\overline{\Delta Q}$ a macro was written in ROOT \cite{ROOTWebPage}. This macro finds and extract the bakcground, which is crucial in some cases like high temperatures or high bias voltages. After that, this macro find all peaks in the SPS spectrum and fits each one to a Gaussian funtion, shown in Figure \ref{subfig:GaussianFitSiPMs}. The value and error of the charge produced by multiple fired pixels are obtained from the centroid and the sigma of the different fitted Gaussian functions. The obtained charges are fitted to the number of fired pixels, Figure \ref{subfig:LinearFitSiPMGain}.

 \label{fig:ROOTAnalysisSiPMGain}
\end{figure}

%As can bee seen in Figure \ref{subfig:GaussianFitSiPMs}, a very good fit is achieved by the ROOT script with a $\chi^2$ test of $\frac{\chi^2}{ndf}=\frac{1276}{223}$. 

Up to 10 simultaneously fired pixels were obtained with a relative uncertainty of the charge measurement of less than $2\%$. The slope of the straight line in Figure \ref{subfig:LinearFitSiPMGain} corresponds to $\overline{\Delta Q}$.

Therefore, for the case measured at the temperature of $25\celsius$, humidity of $H=45\%$ and overvoltage $V_{OV}=3~\volt$, the value obtained for the SiPM gain is $G_{SiPM}=4,11\cdot{} 10^{6}$, very close to the value provided by Hamamatsu, Table \ref{tab:PropertiesOfSiPM1375}.

Finally, a stabilization method for the SiPM gain is tested. This is necessary for the TRITIUM project since the temperature of the final emplacement of the tritium detector cannot be controlled with enough sensitivity to ensure that it does not affect the SiPM gain and, therefore, the tritium measurement. 

This method consists of compensating for variations in the SiPM gain caused by variations in temperature using controlled variations in the bias voltage. For this task, first, the dependence of the SiPM gain with the temperature and bias voltage is experimentally obtained. To do so, on the one hand, the SiPM gain was measured at several temperatures in the range of $[15-41]\celsius$ with steps of $2\celsius$, which is expected to be the temperature range in the final emplacement. The bias voltage used was $V_{bias} = V_{BD}+3$. On the other hand, the SiPM gain was measured at several bias voltage in the range of $[V_{BD}+1-V_{BD}+5]~\volt$ with steps of $0.2~\volt$, wide enough range to obtain the relationship. The temperature used was $T=25\celsius$. Both measurements are shown in Figure \ref{fig:SiPMGainDependance} in which a linear fit was applied.

    \end{subfigure}
 \caption{Dependence of the SiPM gain with the a) Temperature b) Bias votlage.}
 \label{fig:SiPMGainDependance}
\end{figure}

As can be seen, a very good linear trend is obtained for both cases, exhibit in the equation \ref{SiPMGainVSTempV}, with values obtained for the $\chi^2/ndf$ variable of $2.937/12$ and $7.963/21$ respectively. The linear fit obtained for both tests are:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
G_{SiPM}=a \cdot{} T + b;& \qquad G_{SiPM}=c \cdot{} V_{bias} + d\\
a=\left( -82.53 \pm 1.59 \right) \cdot{} 10^{3};& \qquad c=\left( 137.72 \pm 1.50 \right) \cdot{} 10^{4}\\
b=\left( 617.65 \pm 4.53 \right) \cdot{} 10^{4};& \qquad d=\left( -762.16 \pm 8.13 \right) \cdot{} 10^{5} \\
\label{SiPMGainVSTempV}
\end{split}
\end{equation*} 

In addition, the breakdown voltage, $V_{BD}$ and the terminal capacitance $C_t$ can be obtained from the linear fit of the SiPM gain as a function of the bias voltage, $V_{bias}$. Both parameters can be calculed through the definition of the SiPM gain and taking into account that, in a parallel plate capacitor, the charge produced in a pixel is directly proportional to the terminal capacitance of the pixel and the difference voltage in the SiPM:
\begin{equation}
G_{SiPM}=\frac{Q_{pixel}}{e^-} = C_d \frac{V_{bias}-V_{BD}}{e^-} = c \cdot{} V_{bias}+d
\label{SiPMGain_Capacitance}
\end{equation}
where $C_d$ is the capacitance of one pixel.

Therefore, using the linear fit obtained in Figure \ref{subfig:SiPMGainvsBiasVoltage}, a value of $V_{BD}=50.98 \pm 0.59~\volt$ and $C_d{}= 220.63 \pm 2.41~\text{f}\farad$ are obtained. The terminal capacitance of the SiPM can be calculated considering all pixels in parallel, $C_{t}=N_{p}\times C_{d}=62.88 \pm 0.69~\pico\farad$. Both parameters, the breakdown voltage and the terminal capacitance, are agree with the values provided by Hamamatsu, Table \ref{tab:PropertiesOfSiPM1375}. 

Finally, the value of the bias voltage to be applied to compensate for the variation in the SiPM gain due to a variation in the temperature can be obtained from both linear trends of Figure \ref{fig:SiPMGainDependance}, applying variations to them:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
G_{SiPM}=a \cdot{} T + b  &\longrightarrow \partial G_{SiPM}= a \partial T\\
G_{SiPM}=c \cdot{} V_{bias} + d &\longrightarrow \partial G_{SiPM}= a \partial V_{bias}
\label{Gain_compensationVariations}
\end{split}
\end{equation*} 

Therefore, the total variation of the SiPM gain, which is produced by the variation of both parameters, must be equal to zero:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\partial G_{SiPM, tot}= \partial G_{SiPM}(T) &+ \partial G_{SiPM}(V_{bias}) = 0\\ 
\partial G_{SiPM}(V_{bias}) = -\partial G_{SiPM}(T) &\longrightarrow c \partial V_{bias} = - a \partial T\\ 
\partial V_{bias}  = - \frac{a}{c}&\partial T = e \partial T
\label{Gain_compensation0}
\end{split}
\end{equation*} 
where the parámeter $e= 59.93 \pm 1.33~\milli\volt/\celsius $ has been defined as the quotient of the parameters a and c, which are quite in agreement with the value of the temperature coeficient provided by Hamamtsu, Table \ref{tab:PropertiesOfSiPM1375}. Finally, integrating this expression:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\int_{V_i}^{V_f}\partial V_{bias}  = e\int_{T_i}^{T_f}\partial T \longrightarrow \Delta V_{bias} = e \Delta T
\label{Gain_compensationIntegring}
\end{split}
\end{equation} 

This equation express the variation in the voltage, $\Delta V_{bias}$, that must be applied to maintain the SiPM gain when there is a variation in the temperature, $\Delta T$. More interesting is to know the bias voltage, $V_{bias}$ to be applied as a function of the temperature, $T$. To obtain this expression, it is necessary to consider a reference situation, the gain of which is wanted to be maintained. In our case, the reference situation considered is at $V_i=V_{ref}= V_{BD}+3~\volt = 53.98~\volt$ and $T_i=T_{ref}=24\celsius$, at which the value of the gain is $4.2 \cdot{} 10^{6}$ (experimentally measured). Therefore, including this information in the previous equation:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
(V_{bias}-V_{ref} )= e \left( T -T_{ref} \right) 
\label{Gain_compensationEquation}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation}
V_{bias}(\volt)= 59.9 \cdot{} 10^{-3} \cdot{} T(\celsius) + 52.54
\label{Gain_compensationReference}
\end{equation}  

Finally, the stabilization method of the SiPM gain developed was tested. To do so, several measurements were taking varying the temperature in a range of $[21-29]\celsius$ and modifying the bias voltage according to the equation \ref{Gain_compensationReference}. The value of the SiPM gain is shown in Figure \ref{fig:SiPMGainStabilization} as a function of the temperature.

\caption{SiPM gain as a function of the temperature. The Stabilization method is applied in this experience. \label{fig:SiPMGainStabilization}}
\end{figure}

A red dotted line is included, indicating the value of the SiPM gain to be kept. As it has been proven, the SiPM gain is maintained correctly, which shows that the method of stabilizing the SiPM gain works properly.
