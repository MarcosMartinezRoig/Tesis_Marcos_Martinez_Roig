This chapter shows the results obtained in the simulations described in chapter \ref{chap:Simulations}, which is divided in two different sections. The first section contains the results of several simulations used to improve the design of the TRITIUM detector while the second exhibits the results obtianed for the simulation of a full TRITIUM monitor based on an active veto read in anticoincidence with several TRITIUM-IFIC 2 prototypes. As shown throughout the different sections of this chapter, several tests were carried out to verify the correct simulation of the different steps such as the simulated tritium source, the energy deposition in the fibers and the production of photons in them.
