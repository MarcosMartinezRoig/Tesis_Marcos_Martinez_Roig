This section reports experimental measurements of the plastic scintillating fiber parameters relevant for tritium detection, such as collection effficiency and uncertainty caused by the conditioning protocol. Thousands of scintillating fibers are used in the TRITIUM detector which were prepared and conditioned prior to characterization studies or tritium detection. Therefore, various mechanical and electronic devices were developed to automatically prepare large number of fibers simultaneously.
