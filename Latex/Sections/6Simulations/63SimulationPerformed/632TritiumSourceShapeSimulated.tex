First of all, the shape of the simulated tritated water source was optimized. The mean free path of tritium electrons in water is only around $5~\mu\meter$, so most electrons do not reach the scintillating fibers. These electrons do not provide useful information and only consume computing resources. To optimize the simulation, the dimensions of the simulated tritium source were tested to minimizes the number of tritium events that do not reach the scintillating fibers. To do so, a scintillating fiber $20~\cm$ long and $2~\mm$ in diameter and a surrounding tritiated water source of the same length and $0.5~\mm$ thick, $100$ times greater that the mean free path of tritium electrons, were simulated to assess the tritium source. The dimensions of the fiber are not important in this study since only the energy deposition of tritium electrons in the fiber were simulated, excluding optical processes. The results of this simulation are shown in section \ref{subsec:ResultsShapeSource}, where they are discussed.
