This chapter shows and discusses the experimental results obtained with the different prototypes developed in the TRITIUM experiment. This is divided into two sections, according to the place where they were carried out. The first section shows the measurements obtained in the laboratory, where external atmospheric conditions, such as temperature, can be better controlled. The second section shows the measurements obtained at the Arrocampo dam, the TRITIUM monitor installation site, where the control of external atmospheric conditions is less accurate.

%Additionally, an estimation of the results to be obtained with the TRITIUM monitor based on various TRITIUM-IFIC 2 prototypes are also presented in the last section. 

%The experimental results measured with the different prototypes developed in the TRITIUM experiment are shown and discussed in this chapter. Additionally, an estimation of the TRITIUM monitor based on various TRITIUM-IFIC 2 prototypes are also presented. Finally, the last section shows the measurements currently achieved with a TRITIUM-Aveiro 0 prototype installed in Arrocampo dam.
