This thesis is divided into nine different chapters that structure the information as follows:

\textbf{Chapter 1} provides a brief introduction of the importance of tritium detection, shows some important properties of tritium, and discusses the current legislation that limits tritium levels in many countries around the world. \textbf{Chapter 2} exhibit the State-of-the-Art in tritium detection and shortly introduces the TRITIUM project. \textbf{Chapter 3} details the different parts on which the TRITIUM monitor are based, which are the ultrapure water system, the background rejection system (consisting of the lead shielding and the active veto)  and the tritium detector. \textbf{Chapter 4} presents the calibrations of the different parts of the TRITIUM monitor and shows the developments aimed at improving the efficiency of tritium detection. \textbf{Chapter 5} details the geometric configuration of the different prototypes built in the TRITIUM project, the measurements of which are presented \textbf{Chapter 7}. \textbf{Chapter 6} explains the Monte Carlo simulations performed, the result of which are shown in \textbf{Chapter 8}. Finally, \textbf{Chapter 9} summarized the most important results achieved in this work.
