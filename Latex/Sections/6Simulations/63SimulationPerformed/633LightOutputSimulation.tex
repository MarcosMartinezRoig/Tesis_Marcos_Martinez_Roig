The scintillation yield provided by the manufacturer, $8000~\text{phot.}/\MeV$ only works for Minimum Ionizing Particles (MIP). As tritium electron energies are far from being MIP particles, the output light generated by the scintillating fibers was studied. For this task, the energy deposition of tritium electrons on scintillating fibers was added to the simulation.

The proportionality between the output light per unit of path length, $\frac{dL}{dx}$, and the energy deposited per unit of path length $\frac{dE}{dx}$ is affected by the light quenching through the so-called Birks coefficient, following equation \cite{BirksPaper}
\begin{equation}
\frac{dL}{dx}= S\frac{\displaystyle{\frac{dE}{dx}}}{1+k_B\displaystyle{\frac{dE}{dx}}}
\label{eq:birkscoefficient}
\end{equation}
where S is the scintillation yield, provided by the manufacturer. A value of $k_B=0.126~\mm/\MeV$ was considered for the Birk's coefficient which is the one used for scintillators based on polystyrene \cite{BirksCoefficient}. The effect of this correction is shown and discussed in section \ref{subsec:ResultsOutputLight}.
