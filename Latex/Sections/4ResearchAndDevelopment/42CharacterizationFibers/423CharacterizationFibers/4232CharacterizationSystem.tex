%To check the light-tightness of the dark box, the PMT dark current was measured before and after covering the setup by a special black blanket from Thorlabs \cite{BlackBlancket}, that prevents external photons from entering the system. No statistically significant differences was observed between the covered and uncovered setup, which indicates that the black box is sufficiently light tight. 
The experimental setup was placed in a light-tight box. The light-tightness of the box was carefully checked. To select the optimal PMT HV, the photocurrent as a function of the first dynode voltage was measured. The PMT HV was taken as the voltage at the beginning of the plateau ($250~\volt$) shown in Figure \ref{fig:PlateauNoGainPMT}. At this HV the $CE$ is equal to 1 and no secondary electrons are produced. This plot was measured between $0$ and $800~\volt$ without fibers, first with the LED off (PMT dark current) and then with the LED current at $1~\milli\ampere$. The number of photons detected by the PMT (difference between both spectra) is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:PlateauNoGainPMT}.

The linear response of the PMT (in abscence of fibers) was verified both, for a few $~\text{photons}/\nano\second$, which is the expected number of photons for tritium events, and up to $\sim 2500~\text{photons}/\nano\second$, employed for fiber characterization. The results in the low and high illumination cases are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:LinearityRangesOfPMT}, in which no saturation of the PMT response is observed.
