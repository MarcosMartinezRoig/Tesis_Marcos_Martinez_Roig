The scintillating photons created in the core of the fiber and guided to its ends are detected by photosensors. Photosensors have a sensitive part that is optimized to detect photons in a range of energy (usually in the visible range) with a certain probability, called quantum efficiency. The photosensors produce an electronic signal that carries information about the detected photons such as their number, detection time, etc. There are many available photosensors that rely on various physical processes, such as photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) or Charge-Coupled Devices (CCD).  %Each one of these will have different properties and it has to be chosen the one which fit better for the objective of the experiment.

The optimization of the efficiency of a scintillation detector is essential. To do so, the emission spectrum of the scintillator (Figure \ref{fig:EmissionSpectrumFibers} for the fibers used) must overlap as much as possible with the detection efficiency spectrum of the photosensor chosen. The detection efficiency spectrum of a photosensor gives the probability of detecting photons as a function of wavelength. The efficiency of a detector is proportional to the product of both the emission and the detection efficiency spectra and this is largest when both spectra match.

The requirements imposed on the photosensor of the TRITIUM detector are that they be very fast, have high gain and are able to detect a single photon with high photodetection efficiency. Two different porposals for the TRITIUM detector are investigated, SiPMs and PMTs. Both meet these requeriments since they are very fast (of the order of $\nano\second$), have high gain (of the order of $10^{6}$) and have a high photodetection efficiency (around $50\%$ for SiPMs and $30\%$ for PMTs). Each porposal has their own advantage. SiPMs are more robust and need a lower supply voltage (of the order of $50~\volt$) than PMTs (of the order of $1000~\volt$). Furthermore, due to this different in the supply voltage, SiPMs has a smaller cost per unit of channel than PMTs since a SiPM array, which can be feed with a single channel. However PMTs, which are the conventional choice, have lower dark count rate than SiPM a much lower dependence with the temperature.



%A certain portion (in an optimal case nearly 100\%) of the scintillation photons reach the light detector, which has to be sensitive enough to detect a small number of photons. The detector then produces a signal pulse, which has a height proportional to the number of photons hitting the detector. The signal pulse of the detector is processed by the electronics, and as a result a pulse height spectrum is produced (see Section 3.5).

%This spectrum corresponds to the energy spectrum of the detected particles.
