This thesis is divided into nine different chapters that structure the information as follows:

\textbf{Chapter 1} provides a brief introduction to tritium detection, reports some important properties of tritium, and discusses the current legislation that limits tritium levels in many countries around the world. \textbf{Chapter 2} describes the State-of-the-Art of tritium detection and shortly introduces the TRITIUM project. \textbf{Chapter 3} outlines the different parts of the TRITIUM monitor, which are the ultrapure water system, the background rejection system (consisting of the lead shielding and the active veto)  and the tritium detector. \textbf{Chapter 4} reports the calibrations of the different parts of the TRITIUM monitor and specify the developments aimed at improving the efficiency of tritium detection. \textbf{Chapter 5} details the geometrical configuration of the different prototypes built in the TRITIUM project and \textbf{Chapter 7} reports the measurements carried out. \textbf{Chapter 6} details the Monte Carlo simulations performed, the result of which are shown in \textbf{Chapter 8}. Finally, \textbf{Chapter 9} summarizes the most important results achieved in this work.
