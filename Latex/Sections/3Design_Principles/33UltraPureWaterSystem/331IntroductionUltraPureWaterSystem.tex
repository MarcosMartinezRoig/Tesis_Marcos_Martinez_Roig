The water samples, which will be introduced into the TRITIUM detector to be measured, are taken directly from the Tajus river, 4 km downstream from the place where the Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant releases the cooling water. This sample, as it was verified by a detailed analysis shown in section \ref{sec:CharacterizationUltraPureWaterSystem}, contains many dissolved elements such as minerals, organic deposits, and living matter dissolved in the water. You need to delete these dissolved items for several reasons:

%The objective of the water purification system is to purify the water sample before the measurement. This system is important for two reasons:

\begin{enumerate}

\item{} The mean free path of tritium electrons in water is around $5~\mu\meter$ and even less in solid materials like organic material. Tritium decay electrons have to reach the fiber to be detected and, consequently, the detector must be kept very clean. If the analyzed water sample contains particles that may be deposited on the fibers, a layer of matter could be formed, preventing tritium decay electrons from reaching the fibers and reducing drastically the tritium detection efficiency.

\item{} The tritium monitor does not have any spectrometric capabilities that could be used to distinguish tritium from other radioactive elements from minerals dissolved in the water.

The water purification system was designed to remove organic matter and mineral particles with a size of up to $1~\mu\meter$. Hence, this filtering should keep unchanged the tritium level in the water. 

%Since tritium is the only radioactive element that can be practically equal to water (when it is in the $\ce{HTO}$ form, the majority form in wihch tritium are present in the water sample), with this process we remove all particles radioactive elements other than tritium and the amount of tritium present in the sample is not affected

\end{enumerate}

%In summary, the ultrapure water system is used to keep our detector clean, ensuring the stability of its detection efficiency and to eliminate all radioactive particles other than tritium. %maintaining the activity of the tritium in the sample. Both reasons has been tested with experimental measurements, shown in secton \ref{sec:CharacterizationUltraPureWaterSystem}.
