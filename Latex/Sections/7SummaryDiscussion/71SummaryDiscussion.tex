\begin{enumerate}
\item{} During the R\&D tasks, the TRITIUM module was designed and its components, as well as the water purification and the background rejection systems, were characterized and optimized. The TRITIUM module consists of hundreds of scintillating fibers (350 fibers for the TRITIUM-Aveiro prototype and 800 for the TRITIUM-IFIC-2 prototype) arranged in a bundle, inmersed in the water sample. The scintillating fibers detect the tritium decay electrons produced in the water and are read out by photosensors, either PMTs or SiPM arrays. Regarding the detector development, the following results were obtained in this PhD theses:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{} A surface-conditioning method for scintillating fibers, which consists in cleaving, polishing and cleaning the fibers, was developed. A polishing machine, based on Arduino technology and capable of polishing hundreds of fibers automatically, was developed. The objective of this machine was to automate the polishing of hundreds of fibers simultaneously, a task that requires an unaffordable time for the amount of fibers needed for the TRITIUM monitor. The surface-conditioning method resulted in an increase of the light collected by the fibers, a factor of 2 due to polishing and additional $25\%$ due to cleaning. The photon collection efficiency obtained for the uncladded scintillating fibers is $76\pm 8\%$ which is smaller than stated by the manufacturer ($96\%$). The typical deviation of the photon collection efficiency after applying the surface-conditioning method to scintillating fibers was measured, obtaining $2.86\%$, which is acceptable for tritium measurements.

\item{} A characterization of the S13360-6075 Hamamatsu SiPM was carried out. In this characterization, some of the most relevant parameters of the SiPM for detection of tritium, such as gain, breakdown voltage, temperature coefficient and others as the quenching resistance and the terminal capacitance, were measured and compared to the values provided by the manufacturer. The charge of the single photoelectron spectrum was measured with a resolution of $1\%$ for each photoelectron peak and up to $10$ photoelectron peaks were resolved. %small uncertainties in the single photon spectrum (about $1\%$ for each photopeak) and a very good agreement with the values expected by the manufacturer.

%An additional calibration was carried out at the level of a SiPM matrix in which the probability of crosstalk between different SiPMs was measured, obtaining an insignificant probability of happening. The linearity of the SiPM signal as a function of the the number of scintillating fibers was also verified.

Due to the strong dependence of the SiPM gain on temperature, a gain stabilization method was implemented in the $[20-30]~\celsius$ temperature range of interest. This method consists in compensating the variation of the gain due to changes in the temperature by a variation of the bias voltage. Indeed, the gain depends linearly on both temperature and voltage, increasing with voltage and decreasing with temperature. This allows to stabilize the gain to its nominal value at $25~\celsius$ by a variation of $59.9 \pm 1.3 ~\milli\volt/\celsius$ of the bias voltage. This stabilization method was tested, obtaining variations of $0.1\%$ in the SiPM gain in the $[20-30]~\celsius$ temperature range, which is the expected operation range of the TRITIUM monitor. These results indicate that a stable operation of the SiPM readout can be obtained by an automatic implementation of a temperature dependent SiPM bias in the TRITIUM monitor.

\item{} The background rejection system consists of an active veto and a passive shield. The latter consists of a lead castle of $5~\cm$ thick walls, designed by the TRITIUM CENBG team and presently installed in the Arrocampo site. 

The passive shield is aimed at reducing the soft component of the cosmic rays (energies below $200~\MeV$) and the natural radioactive background that affects the tritium measurement. A $5.5$ reduction factor for cosmic ray events due to the lead shield was obtained by simulations. In addition, it is expected that the background of the natural radioactivity (which was not included in these simulations) would be also suppressed by the shield. 

The active veto is aimed to mitigate the cosmic ray hard component of the background (energies above $200~\MeV$). The active veto consists of two parallel plastic scintillating plates of $1~\cm$ thickness, separated $34.2~\cm$ distance, enclosing the TRITIUM modules. The plastic scintillator was three fold wrapped in PTFE layer, aluminium layer and black tape layers, each plate read by two photosensors. This wrapping improved by a factor $2$ the light collection and produced a better uniformity on the detector surface. In addition, settings that optimize the detection of hard cosmic events, such as discrimination thresholds and photosensor high voltage bias, were found. A hard cosmic rate of $2.5~\text{events}/\text{s}$ was measured, which gives an efficiency of the cosmic veto of $85\%$ with respect to the spected cosmic ray event rate at sea level. Furthermore, the energy spectrum fits very well to a Landau function. Finally, the dependence of the hard cosmic rate on the distance between the scintillating plates was studied, which allows us to change this distance without needing to perform a new calibration of the veto. A $60\%$ reduction of the hard cosmic ray events due to the active veto was obtained through simulations. Finally, a $92.7\%$ suppression of the cosmic ray rate was obtained by simulations by the whole background rejection system. The real suppression will be measured of the Arrocampo site.

\item{} Regarding the water purification system, a detailed analysis of the Arrocampo water was carried out. Due to the presence of the high concentrations of organic components at the site, a water purification system is needed. The TRITIUM LARUEX team designed and installed a water purification system at the Arrocampo site, consisting of several filtering stages that eliminate all organic matter and mineral particles of more than $1~\mu\meter$ size. Conductivities close to $10~\mu\text{S}/\cm$ (two orders of magnitud less than the raw water) were achieved. Furthermore, the water tritium activity did not changed after the purification process.

\end{enumerate}

%Important results were obtained through simulations, which were implemented in the built prototypes. It was seen that the efficiency of tritium detection in the prototypes is larger when short fibers (about $20~\cm$) are used insted of long fibers ($1~\meter$). An improvement of a factor $5$ is acheived in the tritium count rate measured. Also, it was found that the tritium measurement is optimized when $1~\mm$ fibers are used, compared with  $2~\mm$, since a smaller background in the energy region of interest for the tritium measurement due to cosmic ray events is obtained.

\item{} Four different detector prototypes, called TRITIUM-IFIC-0, TRITIUM-IFIC-1, TRITIUM-Aveiro and TRITIUM-IFIC-2, listed in chronological order, were developed by the TRITIUM collaboration. The first two prototypes, TRITIUM-IFIC-0 and TRITIUM-IFIC-1, were used as a proof of concept for the detection of tritium in water with scintillating fibers and to identify the different issues that affect the detection efficiency. The latest prototypes, TRITIUM-Aveiro and TRITIUM-IFIC-2, have slightly different designs. Small tritium activities were used to measure their tritium detection efficiency and MDA. %Each design has its own advantages and disadvantages and the characteristics of each one with the best results will be implemented in the final design of the TRITIUM module.

In the first prototypes, a straight arrangement of the scintillating fibers was found critical for tritium detection. In addition, a surface-conditioning method of the scintillating fibers was implemented, that improved the tritium detection efficiency. The use of a PTFE vessel was also found to improve the light collection due to its optical properties (reflectivity close to $95\%$ for visible light). All these improvements were applied to the TRITIUM-IFIC-1 prototype, obtaining a factor $10$ improvement in the measured count rate of tritium with the respect to the first prototype. %Finally, the use of two photosensors in time coincidence  improved the prototype MDA, since this reduces the photosensor noise. %with almost no affecting to the tritium signal.

In the latest prototype, two photosensors in time coincidence was used to improve the prototype MDA, since this reduces the photosensor noise. These two prototypes have a similar design but with subtle differences. One of the most important difference is the use of a different scintillating fibers diameter ($2~\mm$ for the TRITIUM-Aveiro prototype and $1~\mm$ for the TRITIUM-IFIC-2 prototype). Fibers of $1~\mm$ allow to fit more of them in the same volume. This increases the total active area of the prototype (and, therefore its tritium detection efficiency) and the signal-to-background ratio (improving the MDA). Fibers of $2~\mm$ may facilitate the water flow through the fiber bundle, which may increase the effective detection area. In addition, $2~\mm$ fibers are stiffer which could be important for high water fluxes. It was obtained through simulations that the cosmic rate in the energy range of interest is a factor $2$ higher for scintillating fibers of $2~\mm$. Additional measurements need to be done to decide the final fiber diameter. A possible way to take this decision could be to build two identical TRITIUM prototypes, one with $1~\mm$ fibers and the other with $2~\mm$ fibers and compare their results. 

The second important difference between the TRITIUM-Aveiro and TRITIUM-IFIC-2 prototypes is the type of photosensor proposed. TRITIUM-Aveiro uses PMTs and for TIRITIUM-IFIC-2 it is proposed SiPM arrays. SiPM arrays have some advantages such as a higher photodetection efficiency, which would increase the detection efficiency of the TRITIUM detector. Furthermore, the SiPMs do not need high voltage, which implies a reduction of the TRITIUM monitor cost. However, SiPM arrays have some disadvantages as the need to read out more channels, which complicates the electronics. In addition, a gain stabilization method is needed due to the strong dependence of the SiPMs gain on temperature.

The specific efficiency obtained with the TRITIUM-IFIC-2 prototype, $(141.6 \pm 6) \times 10^{-6}~ \second^{-1}  \liter ~ \kilo\becquerel^{-1} \cm^2$, is better than that obtained with the TRITIUM-Aveiro prototype, $(16 \pm 5)\times 10^{-6}~ \second^{-1}  \liter ~ \kilo\becquerel^{-1} \cm^2$, most probably due to the surface-conditioning method applied to the fibers of the IFIC prototype. In addition, an MDA of $677~\becquerel/\liter$ was obtained for the TRITIUM-IFIC-2 prototype for an integration time of $10~\min$ and$218~\becquerel/\liter$ for an integration time of $1~\hour$, to be compared to the TRITIUM-Aveiro prototype, with an MDA of $29.8~\kilo\becquerel/\liter$ for an integration time of $1~\min$ and $5~\kilo\becquerel/\liter$ for an integration time of $1~\hour$. A lower MDA allows to discriminate smaller tritium activities from the background. An integration time of $1~\hour$ can still be considered a quasi-real time.

A summary of the state-of-the-art of the tritium detection is shown in Table \ref{tab:ComparisonResultsTritium}, which includes the results obtained with the four different prototypes developed in the TRITIUM project. As it can be seen, the TRITIUM-IFIC-2 prototype ameliorates the current state-of-the-art, obtaining a specific efficiency and MDA almost an order of magnitud better than the results obtained in previous experiments (Singh or Hofstetter).

One of the most relevant properties of the TRITIUM monitor is that it is scalable, which means that a lower MDA can be achieved by using a larger number of modules. The MDA of the TRITIUM monitor is expected to decrese with the square root of the number of modules. Therefore, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:MDATRITIUMmonitor}, an MDA of  $100~\becquerel/\liter$ (goal of the TRITIUM project) could be achieved by using 5 TRITIUM-IFIC-2 modules and an integration time of $1~\hour$. It has to be taken into account that the MDA reported in this PhD work was measured without the installation of the background rejection system. The TRITIUM MDA is expected to improve when the background rejection system is included.

The stability of the tritium detection efficiency of the latest TRITIUM prototypes was monitored during six months, obtaining a stable behavior of the detector during this time with a relative standard deviation of $2.5\%$ for the measured tritium rate. 

\item{} Finally, simulations were carried out to determine the dependence of the tritium detection efficiency and activity resolution of the TRITIUM-IFIC-2 prototype on integration time and number of prototypes. These simulations, which agree with the experimental measurements with this prototype, allow us to determine de number of modules needed in the TRITIUM monitor and the integration time to be used. The present options are three modules read in parallel with an integration time of $30~\min$, with which an uncertainty in the tritium concentration of $250~\becquerel/\liter$ is expected to be measured or five modules with an integration time of $10~\min$ with which a difference of $200~\becquerel/\liter$ in the tritium concentration could be measured.

\end{enumerate}

At present, the lead shielding, the water purification system and a TRITIUM-Aveiro prototype are installed in the Arrocampo site. Two additional TRITIUM-Aveiro prototypes and an active veto are planned to be installed as soon as possible. Furthermore, three TRITIUM-IFIC-2 prototypes and an active veto are ready to be installed too, which installation was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.
