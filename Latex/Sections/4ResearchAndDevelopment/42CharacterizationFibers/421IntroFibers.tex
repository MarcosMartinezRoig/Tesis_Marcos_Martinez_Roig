This section reports experimental measurements of the scintillating fiber parameters that most affect the tritium detection, such as collection effficiency and conditioning uncertainty. Errors are included in all graphs displayed but they are to small to be visible. Thousands of scintillating fibers are used in TRITIUM detector which were prepared and conditioned prior to characterization studies or tritium detection. Therefore, various mechanical and electronical devices were developed to automatically prepare many fibers at the same time.
