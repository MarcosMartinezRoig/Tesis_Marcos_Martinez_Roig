The TRITIUM-IFIC-1 prototype was designed to overcome the problems and limitations found in TRITIUM-IFIC 0. The main improvements were:

\begin{enumerate}

\item{} The fiber bundle was arranged straight to optimize the photon collection efficiency of the fibers. In addition, a PTFE matrix was used to maintain a distance of $1~\mm$ between fibers.

\item{} A special fiber cleaning method, described in section \ref{subsec:SurfaceConditioningProcess}, was applied to the fibers to improve the quality of the interfaces between the fibers and tritiated water. This method produces a better wetting property of the fibers, which improves their photon collection efficiency.

\item{} A PTFE vessel was used to improve the collection of photons inside the prototype. Indeed, PTFE has a reflectivity close to $100\%$ at the fiber scintillating wavelengths. Thus, the photons that escape from fibers and hit the vessel walls are refelcted back to the scintillating fibers.

\end{enumerate}

The TRITIUM-IFIC-1 prototype consists of 64 straight scintillating fibers of $20~\cm$ length, arranged in an $8\times 8$ PTFE squared matrix, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:TeflonStructureFibersTritiumIFIC1}.

The cleaning process described in section \ref{subsec:SurfaceConditioningProcess} was applied to the fibers to achieve a better tritiated water-fiber interface. A PVC piece was used to attach the photosensor to the prototype and prevent external light from being read out. A general view of this prototype is shown in Figure \ref{fig:TritumIFIC1}.

%A general view of TRITIUM-IFIC-1 prototype, where can be seen the lodging for the PMT to be coupled to the fibers, on the top cover of the detector.

The prototype was instrumented with a PMT model R8520-460, from Hamamatsu Photonics company \cite{DataSheetPMTs}, coupled directly to the fiber bundle using optical grease \cite{OpticalGrease}. The quantum efficiency of this PMT for the fiber scintillating wavelength is $28.66\%$.  The voltage divider, shown in Figure \ref{fig:VoltageDividerCircuit}, was used to polarize the PMT. The high voltage was $-800~\volt$. The signal from this PMT was acquired using the same electronics as for TRITIUM-IFIC-0 prototype, shown in Figure \ref{subfig:ElectronicConfiguraiton1PMT}. Unlike the first prototype, only one TRITIUM-IFIC-1 prototype was built. In a first measurement, this prototype was filled with pure water ($118~\milli\liter$, uncertainty of $0.05\%$) and several background measurements were taken over a week. Then, it was emptied and refilled with $118~\milli\liter$ (uncertainty of $0.05\%$) of a tritiated water source of the same specific activity as the one used for TRITIUM-IFIC-0 prototype, $99.696~\kilo\becquerel/\liter$. 

The measured signal and background energy spectra are shown in Figure \ref{subfig:SignalBackgroundEnergySpectraTritiumIFIC1}. The difference between both energy spectra corresponds to the tritium energy spectrum, shown in Figure \ref{subfig:TritiumEnergySpectraTritiumIFIC1}. The detection efficiency was obtained as in the previous section. The rates measured are given in Table \ref{tab:CountsPerSecondTRITIUMIFIC1}, which are obtained from the integration of each spectrum.

The tritium detection efficiency obtained for TRITIUM-IFIC-1 is $(3.84 \pm 0.16)\cdot{} 10^{-2}~\frac{cps}{\kilo\becquerel/\liter}$. The specific efficiency obtained is
$$S=(9.56 \pm 0.40)\cdot{} 10^{-5}~\frac{cps}{\kilo\becquerel/\liter \cdot{} \cm^{2}}$$
which is a factor ten better than that of TRITIUM-IFIC-0. Furthermore, compared to the scintillating detectors developed in other experiments for tritium in water measurements, given in table \ref{tab:PlasticScinTritium}, the efficiency of this prototype is very close to the best result, obtained by Singh \cite{Ratnakaran, Ratnakaran2000}, $4,1 \cdot{} 10^{-2}~\frac{cps}{\kilo\becquerel/\liter}$, and the specific efficiency, which is the most relevant parameter for comparison, is almost 5 times larger than that obtained by Hofstetter \cite{Hofstetter1, Hofstetter2}, $<22.2 \cdot{} 10^{-6}~\frac{cps}{\kilo\becquerel/\liter\cm^{2}}$.
