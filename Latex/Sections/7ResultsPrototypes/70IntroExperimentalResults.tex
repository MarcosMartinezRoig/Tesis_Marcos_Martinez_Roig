The experimental results measured with the different prototypes developed in the TRITIUM experiment are shown and discussed in this chapter, which are divided into two sections, according to the place where they were carried out. The first section shows the measurements obtained at the University Laboratory (at the IFIC or University of Aveiro) and the second section shows the measurements obtained at the Arrocampo dam, the final TRITIUM monitor emplacement.

Additionally, an estimation of the results to be obtained with the TRITIUM monitor based on various TRITIUM-IFIC 2 prototypes are also presented in the last section.
