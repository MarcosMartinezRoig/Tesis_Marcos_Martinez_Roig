This chapter shows the characterization of each individual part of the TRITIUM monitor, which includes scintillating fibers, SiPMs (at the individual SiPM level and at the matrix level), the ultrapure water system and the background rejection system, consisting of the lead shielding and the active veto. 

This characterization is one of the most important things to do because it will help us to understand their behaviour and the results obtained with the complete monitor. Furthermore, we have made some developments to improve interesting parameters of the TRITIUM monitor components to enhance the monitor's capabilities of tritium detection.

All these studies have been carried out inside a special light-tight box, called black box, to ensure that the photons we are detecting come from the photon sources used, whether they are emitted by LEDs or by scintillators. In addition, because of the reason that we cannot do an accurate energy calibration when using plastic scintillators, we will show some of their energy spectrums in units of channels (units of ADC), which are linearly proportional to the units of energy.
