This chapter describes the characterization of the different parts of the TRITIUM monitor, including scintillating fibers, SiPMs, the ultrapure water system and the background rejection system. This characterization is crucial to understand the behaviour of the different parts and the results of the monitor. Furthermore, several developments were made  to improve fundamental parameters of the TRITIUM monitor components to enhance their tritium sensitivity. All these studies were carried out inside a special light-tight box, called black box, to ensure that the detected photons come from the sources used, either LEDs or scintillators. In addition, as the energy response of plastic scintillators has a rather large uncertainty, most of the energy spectra are shown in ADC\footnote{ADC units are the internal units, called channels, in which an analog signal is digitized after an Analog-to-Digital Converter. The ADC units are proportional to the energy and the number of available channels depends on the bits used in its digitization.} channels, which are linearly proportional to energy.
