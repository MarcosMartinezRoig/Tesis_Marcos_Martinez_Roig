The preliminary prototypes, TRITIUM-IFIC-0 and TRITIUM-IFIC-1, were designed and built at the IFIC workshop. They are a small-scale proof of concept of the final TRITIUM detector module. They allowed us to learn about in-water tritium detection, to identify design issues and to implement improvements for the final monitor.
