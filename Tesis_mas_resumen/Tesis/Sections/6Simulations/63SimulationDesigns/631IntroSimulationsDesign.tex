Several simulations were performed during the design of the TRITIUM detector to quantify the influence of some parameters as the diameter and the length of the scintillating fibres to optimize tritium detection. As the tritium electrons have a very short mean free path, the shape of the simulated tritium source was optimized to reduce computing time.
