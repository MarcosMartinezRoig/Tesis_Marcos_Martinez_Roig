Two preliminary prototypes, TRITIUM-IFIC-0 and TRITIUM-IFIC-1, are reported in this section, which were designed, developed and built at the IFIC workshop. These prototypes were thought to be a small scale proof of concept  of the final TRITIUM detector module. They helped to learn about tritium detection, to detect design problems and to implement improvements for the final prototype.
