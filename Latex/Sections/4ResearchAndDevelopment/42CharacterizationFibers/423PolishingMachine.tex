At this point it has to be taken into account that, as it is shown in sections \ref{subsec:TritiumAveiro} and \ref{subsec:TritiumIFIC2}, hundred of scintillating fibers are used in the latest prototypes developet in TRITIUM experiment, Tritium-Aveiro 0 and Tritium-IFIC 2, which means that tens of thousands of fibers  need to be prepared and conditioned for the TRITIUM monitor\footnote{Tritium prototype will be a module of TRITIUM monitor, based on dozens of modules.}, section \ref{sec:TritiumMonitor}.

While this amount of fibers is not a problem for the cutting process, as it is very fast, the polishing process would be too time consuming. It takes more than ten minutes to polish each fiber, resulting in an inaccessible amount of time to prepare the needed amount of fibers (years).

Therefore, an automatic polishing machine for scintillating fibers was designed, developed, built and tested, shown in Figure \ref{fig:GeneralViewPolishingMachine}. This polishing machine is able to polish up to one hundred scintillating fibers at the same time and automatically. Furthermore, it is easily scalable to increase its capacity.

As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:GeneralViewPolishingMachine}, the automatic polishing machine is based on two parts. On the one hand, the polishing table, where the fibers will be polished and, on the other hand, the electronics, based on arduino technology, used to control the movement of the polishing table:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{} The polishing table, shown in Figure \ref{subfig:PolishingTable}, can be divided in two parts, the immobile part, where the fibers will be fixed, and the mobile part, where the polishing papers will be fixed. It was decided to move the polishing papers because they are lighter and mechanically easier than fibers.

The immobile part consists of a piece, shown in Figure \ref{subfig:PolishingTable}, which was designed and built with a 3D printer, fixed to the system with four vertical screws. There are two nuts on each screw that are used to set the height and the inclination of fibers relative to the polishing papers. This piece contains one hundred holes where the fibers will be placed. 

Fibers use their own weight to press the polishing paper. Due to the reason that they are light ($0.16~\gram$), we use a plastic belt and a piece of metal with a weight of around $1.5~\gram$, shown in Figure \ref{subfig:FiberMetailcPiece}, to increase their weight (in the same way as in thorlabs polishing process).

The mobile part consists of a flat PMMA plate, whose dimensions are $18 \cdot{} 18~\cm^2$, on which the polishing paper is fixed. This part is fixed to two horizontal screws, perpendicular to each other, shown in Figure \ref{subfig:HorizontalAxis}, that are used to move it around the XY plane (horizontal plane).

This system contains multiple switches, each mounted on a piece designed with a 3D printer, shown in Figures \ref{subfig:PolishingTable}, \ref{subfig:HorizontalAxis} and \ref{subfig:3DSwitchPiece}, which are used to find the coordinates origin when the system is reinitiated and to stop it if they reach the end of the path.

\end{figure}

\item{} The electronic part, shown in Figure \ref{fig:ElectronicSystemPolishingMachine}, is based on arduino technology and it is used to achieve automatic movement of the polishing paper.

It consists of two stepper motors, model NEMA ST4209S1404-A \cite{StepperMotors}, which are used to control the horizontal screws on which the polishing paper is fixed. These motors are controlled by an arduino UNO \cite{ArduinoUNO} that uses a CNC shield \cite{CNCShield} in which two different drivers are connected to control the stepper motors, one driver for each stepper motor.

Drivers are controllers that allow to manage stepper motors in a simple way. It is very important to choose the correct controller for the system because it can limit the supply power to the motors, burning the motors in the worst case. Instead of using the Pololu A4988 drivers \cite{A4988Driver}, which is one of the most widely used drivers, the first choice was the DRV8825 driver \cite{DRV8825Driver}. DRV8825 allows to power the motor with higher voltage and intensities ($45~\volt$ and $2.5~\ampere$) than A4988 ($35~\volt$ and $2~\ampere$). Also, the DRV8825 controller includes a new microstepping mode ($1/32$) compared to the A4988 ($1/16$) with which we get more accurate and smooth movements.

Finally the drivers was replaced by the TMC2208 \cite{TMC2208Driver}, much less noisy since it includes the \textit{StealthChop} function with which the noise is practically eliminated. Furthermore, this controller is much more accurate as it has a microstepping mode of $1/256$.

The voltage and current used to power the motors are similar to the A4988 ($35~\volt$ and $2~\ampere$) which is sufficient for the system since the used motors are limited to $1.33~\ampere$. 

The excess current will be transformed into heat that has to be dissipated from the system. Overheating of the drivers can cause loss of steps, producing movements different from those programmed or even destroying the driver. Therefore, a cooling system is needed to ensure the correct operation of the polishing system.

The cooling system, shown in Figure \ref{fig:ElectronicSystemPolishingMachine}, a copper piece\footnote{The copper is one of the best thermal conductor at STP} in contact with both controllers. It has the possibility to use a PELTIER cell to increase the cooling power of this system. A fan is also included to prevent heat accumulation inside the electronics box.

\end{enumerate}

This polishing machine is controlled by a computer using the Universal G-code Sender software (a grafical interface based on the GRBL package). It has several useful pre-programmed functions such as "HOME" with which the system, using the previously installed switches, finds its origin coordinate every time the system is turned on. 

It also has the ability to load a file containing the g-code to be executed, which is used in TRITIUM experiment to program the 120 movements required for each polishing paper.

To test this machine, tuenty fibers with a length of $15~\cm$ were cut and arranged in a bundle. They were fixed in a structure shown in Figure \ref{fig:BunchWith2PMTsCoincidence} with two PMTs located at their ends, which were read in time coincidence using the electronic system described in section \ref{subsubsec:PMTsElectronicalSystem}, Figure \ref{subfig:ElectronicConfiguraiton2PMT}.

\caption{Set up used to test the effect of the polishing machine.\label{fig:BunchWith2PMTsCoincidence}}
\end{figure}

Two different measurements were taken using two different radioactive sources, a gamma source, $\ce{^{60}Co}$, whose activity was approximately $715~\becquerel$, and a beta source, $\ce{^{90}Sr}$, whose activity was approximately $17.8~\kilo\becquerel$. After that, the fiber bundle was polished with the polishing machine developed and the test was repeated.

The energy spectrums recorded are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ResultsOfPolishingMachine} for each radioactive source, which were placed in the middle of the fiber bunch, that's, $7.5~\cm$ from each PMT.

    \end{subfigure}
 \caption{Energy spectrums used to test the effect of the Polishing machine}
 \label{fig:ResultsOfPolishingMachine}
\end{figure}

As can be seen in these figures, both energy spectrums have shifted to the right of the spectrum, which means that the detected events have more energy (more photons per event has reached the PMTs). This increase was quantified in more than 40\% ($(42 \pm 4.6)\%$ for gamma source and $(49 \pm 8.4)\%$ for beta source).

In summary, with the polishing machine, the photon collection efficiency of the fibers after their cut has been improved  (mainly for the improvement of the interface between fibers and PMTs). It is very important to achieve a high detector efficiency as the expected number of photons in a tritium event is very low.
