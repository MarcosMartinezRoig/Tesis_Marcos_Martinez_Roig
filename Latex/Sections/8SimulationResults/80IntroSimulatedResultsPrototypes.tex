This chapter shows the results obtained in the simulations carried out in the TRITIUM experiment, which were described in chapter \ref{chap:Simulations}. This is divided in two different sections. The first one presents the results of the simulations used to improve the design of the TRITIUM detector while the second exhibits the results obtianed for the simulation of the TRITIUM monitor based on TRITIUM-IFIC 2 prototype.
