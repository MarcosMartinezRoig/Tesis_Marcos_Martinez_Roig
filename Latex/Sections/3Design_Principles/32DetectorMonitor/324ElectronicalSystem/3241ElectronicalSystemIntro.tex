The electronics is in charge of collecting, processing and storing the output signals of photosensors (raw data). This electronics depends on the detector configuration used.

This section describes the electronics for the TRITIUM detector when SiPM arrays are used (PETsys) and the electronics employed for the characterization of a single SiPM and PMTs.

For the final TRITIUM prototype there are two different porposals for the DAQ system: the PETsys system and an especific electronic system developed by Aveiro group to read the TRITIUM monitor with PMTs. This electronics is described in Appendix \ref{App:ElectronicSystemAveiro}.

%In each type of detector configuration, this electronic system will also be different depending on the type of information we want to obtain. For example, it will be different if we want to obtain an energy spectrum as output information or simply a number such as the number of counts per second of our detector or the output electrical current. Each electron system that has been used in our experiment will be explained during this section.
