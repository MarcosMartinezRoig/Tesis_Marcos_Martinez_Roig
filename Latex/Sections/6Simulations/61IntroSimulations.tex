This chapter details the Monte Carlo simulations that were performed in the TRITIUM experiment. Their goal were to choose the best design for the TRITIUM detector, understand its behavior and find its limitaitons. The simulation environment used for this task is Geant4 \cite{Geant4WebPage, Geant4P}.
