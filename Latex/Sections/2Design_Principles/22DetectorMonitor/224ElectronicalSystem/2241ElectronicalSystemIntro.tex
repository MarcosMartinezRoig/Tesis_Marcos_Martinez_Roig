The last part we need to have a complete scintillator detector is the electronic system that is the part in charge of reading, processing and analyzing the output signal of the photosensor used and providing us with information that we can interpret.

This electronic system will depend on the type of output signal that we have in our detector. Therefore, it will be different for the different configurations of our detector that has been tested in our experiment. It includes PMT, SiPM at the level of a single channel and SiPM at the level of a SiPM matrix and these will be the parts into which this section is divided.

%In each type of detector configuration, this electronic system will also be different depending on the type of information we want to obtain. For example, it will be different if we want to obtain an energy spectrum as output information or simply a number such as the number of counts per second of our detector or the output electrical current. Each electron system that has been used in our experiment will be explained during this section.
