The characterization of the cosmic active shield (cosmic veto), which was carried out using PMTs as photosensors, is reported in this section. The quality of the veto wrapping was checked. The configuration of the electronics used was the one given in Figure \ref{subfig:ElectronicConfiguraiton2PMT}. The surface of the veto was divided in 9 parts, depicted in Figure \ref{fig:MappingPoints}, on which a gamma source was placed for this test. Two different tests were carried out:

\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}

\item{} To quantify the improvement of the veto signal due to wrapping, a $\ce{^{137}Cs}$ source was placed at point 2 before wrapping and an energy spectrum was measured. The measurement was repeated after wrapping. The spectra obtained are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:VetoCoverageImprovement}.

\caption{Energy spectra measured with the $\ce{^{137}Cs}$ radioactive source with and without wrapping the veto.\label{fig:VetoCoverageImprovement}}
\end{figure}

The spectrum of the wrapped veto is shifted about a factor two to higher energies, which means that more photons per event are collected. No improvement was obtained on the number of events detected, only on the photon collection efficiency.

%a comparison is made between the measurement of cover and uncover veto, placing the gamma source in 3 different points, 1, 2 and 3. This study is used 

\item{} The spatial uniformity of the signal of the wrapped veto was evaluated. A mapping of the veto response to a $\ce{^{60}Co}$ source placed successively on each test point was done for two different veto modules and the energy spectra obtained were integrated. The counting rates obtained are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:MappingVetos}. It can be observed that the veto signal has a uniform response on its whole surface, giving a fairly similar counting rate at all the points.

In a second test, two cosmic vetos were studied in coincidence. The electronic configuration of Figure \ref{subfig:ElectronicConfiguraiton4PMT} was employed. The output signal of the coincidence module was connected to a 1145 CAEN Quad Scaler And Preset Counter-Timer module \cite{ScalerDataSheet}. The goal of this test was to find the PMT high voltage and the threshold discrimination for which the detection of cosmic rays is optimized. The test consisted in finding the PMT high voltage plateau on which the veto efficiency is constant and the discriminator threshold plateau on which no loss of cosmic events is produced. The counting rate was measured versus the PMT high voltage at three different thresholds ($60~\milli\volt$, $100~\milli\volt$ and $200~\milli\volt$) and versus the threshold at three different PMT high voltages ($700~\volt$, $730~\volt$ and $780~\volt$). The counting rate was measured in a time window of $300~\second$. The results are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:HVandThresholdsPLateaus}. The PMT high voltage chosen was $800~\volt$ since it is on the plateau for the three threshold settings and the threshold chosen was $200~\milli\volt$ which is on the plateau for the selected high voltage.

The energy spectrum of cosmic rays was measured using the electronics of Figure \ref{subfig:ElectronicConfiguraiton4PMT}. A plot of this spectrum is shown in Figure \ref{fig:EnergySpectrumCosmicVeto}. 
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{4ResearchAndDevelopments/43CosmicVetos/Cosmic_Energy_Spectrum_36_cm_Landau_Function.pdf}
\caption{Energy spectrum measured with the cosmic veto.\label{fig:EnergySpectrumCosmicVeto}}
\end{figure}
As expected, this energy spectrum fits well to a Landau function. The cosmic ray rate determined from the area of this spectrum is $2.5~$event$/\second$. The expected cosmic rate calculated in section \ref{subsec:SetUpActiveShield} is $2.9~$event$/\second$. Thus, the efficiency of the active veto is $85\%$, which is a usual value of the efficiency of plastic detectors for mips. Finally, the detected cosmic ray rate versus the separation distance between the two cosmic vetos was measured. The spectra are shown in Figure \ref{subfig:EnergySpectrumsSeveralDistanceVeto}. The counting rate decreases with the distance but the spectrum shape and peak position remain unchanged. The integrated spectrum as a function of distance was fitted to a second degree polynomial. The fit is shown in Figure \ref{subfig:LinearFitSeveralDistanceVeto} and allows us to estimate the cosmic ray rate for a given veto separation.

%As can be seen, the shape of the spectrum is the same because the energy of the detected events is the same (cosmic events) but the quantity of their events is less for greater distance. The reason for that is that when the distance is increased, the solid angle formed by the active veto is smaller.

%The detected cosmic events was calculated by the area integral and they are represented in Figure \ref{subfig:LinearFitSeveralDistanceVeto} as a function of the distance between both detectors, where a linear fit has been added. With this linear fit, the detected cosmic rate can be easily known if the working distance is changed.

%También se realizaron varias medias para ver como afecta una fuente gama. Discutir con Pepe como plantear esta medida o si merece la pena ponerla o no.

%Como es de esperar esta deja muy poca señal en el centelleador ya que este tiene muy poca eficiencia para gammas.
