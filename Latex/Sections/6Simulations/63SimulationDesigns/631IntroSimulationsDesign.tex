Several simulations were performed during the design of the TRITIUM detector, which were used to quantify the influence of some modifications and to choose those that optimize the tritium detection. The characteristics studied are the diameter and length of the scintillating fibers. As the tritium electrons have a very short mean free path, the shape of the simulated tritium source was also studied to reduce computing time.
