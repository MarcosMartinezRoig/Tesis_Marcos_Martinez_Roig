Based on the results achieved, it is premature to initiate Phase 2 and commit to a prototype design for construction and test. Significant improvements must be made in fluor-doped fiber performance in order to use the method for in situ monitoring to verify compliance with current EPA drinking water standards. Additional Phase 1 fiber development work should be performed to increase the fluor dopant concentration above 2% until the self-absorption limit is observed. Continued fiber optimization work is expected to improve the sensitivity limits, and will enable application of the detector to verify compliance with the US EPA drinking water standard of 20,000 pico Curies per liter. However, if the need for monitoring higher levels of tritium in water at concentrations greater than 200,000 pico Curies per liter is justified, then prototype development and testing could proceed either as a Phase 2 stand-alone effort or in parallel with continued Phase 1 development work.},

	title	={Measurements of Tritium Radioactivity in Surface Water on the Upper Silesia Region},
	abstractNote = {Tritium is produced naturally in the upper atmosphere by cosmic radiation. Oxygen atoms combine with the radioactive hydrogen atoms (tritium) to form radioactive water molecules, which reach the Earth in rain. This radioactive water seeps into groundwater, where the tritium decays with time. By measuring the concentration of radioactive tritium in a groundwater sample, geologists can approximate the age of water and pinpoint where the water recharges (replenishes) and discharges (exits) from an aquifer. Geologists can estimate groundwater flow rate and direction, and determine whether water from a shallow aquifer has a ready pathway to a deeper aquifer or not. The possibility of measuring the level of tritium radioactivity gave a chance to use tritium as a natural tracer in the water systems. The measurements of tritium radioactivity in groundwater are becoming important. Especially nowadays when tritium levels in precipitation have returned to pre-bomb values (4-25 TU) and the technogenic emissions of tritium are becoming more significant, and may affect its natural patterns on a local or regional scale. This article presents the results obtained in 1998 by measuring tritium radioactivity in surface-water and precipitation. All analyzed samples were taken during 1995-1996, from the Upper Silesia area. The obtained results confirmed, that tritium concentration has returned to the pre-bomb values.},

	title	={Transmutation Effects observed with Heavy Hydrogen},
	abstractNote = {In our paper “Transmutation of Elements by Protons,”* we showed that the transformation of some of the light elements by protons could be conveniently studied by the use of comparatively low voltages—of the order of 100,000 volts—by generating an intense narrow beam of protons which fell on the target of small area of about 1 sq. cm. In the light of experience of the past year, the installation has been modified in several particulars and entirely reconstructed. By the addition of another 100,000-volt transformer in tandem and the use of appropriate condensers the D. C. voltage available has been raised from 200,000 to 400,000 volts. The main change, however, consists in the use of a horizontal instead of a vertical discharge tube. In place of glass, a corrugated porcelain wall bushing capable of withstanding high voltages has been used to insulate the positive electrode, while the earthed metal casing forming the negative electrode projects through a brick wall. The arrangement of the internal electrodes is, in general, similar to that used in the earlier apparatus. The oil cooling circulation has been improved as the electrodes cannot, now be cooled by radiation alone. As before a magnetic field is applied to sort out the various types of ions generated in the discharge tube. The use of the horizontal tube has many advantages, not only for assembling the controls at convenient points but also in the ease of handling the counting apparatus and absorbing screens. The new installation has worked smoothly and satisfactorily and we have been able to increase the number of disintegration particles available for study by a factor of 10 to 50. The thick brick wall acts as a complete screen for the X-radiation generated in the system.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the Monte Carlo method and numerical model are used to build the electrical model of a SiC-based betavoltaic microbattery using a 3H source, and the influences of structural parameters and the surface recombination effect on the output characteristics of the SiC PN battery are simulated. According to Monte Carlo calculations based on the energy spectrum of the 3H source, the ionization energy deposition approaches the exponential distribution along the depth direction, and most of the 22rs are concentrated near the material surface. The ionization energy deposition data is converted into non-equilibrium carrier information for the numerical simulation of the battery&rsquo;s output characteristics. The simulation results show that the conversion efficiency of the battery rises first, and then decreases with the increase of the doping concentration of the N region. This is because the N region-doping affects the depletion region width and the built-in electrical potential at the same time. After considering the surface recombination effect, the conversion efficiency decreased significantly. Thinning the thickness of or moderately reducing the doping concentration of the P region will weaken the surface recombination effect.},

	abstractNote = {Radiation doses from organically bound tritium (OBT) in foods have been a major concern near nuclear facilities. The current dose coefficient for OBT is calculated using a standard model from the International Commission on Radiological Protection, in which some biokinetic values are not based on human metabolic data. Here, the biokinetics of ingested OBT, and radiation doses from them, were estimated by administering labelled compounds and foods to volunteers, using a deuterium (D) tracer as a substitute for tritium. After the administration of D-labelled glucose, alanine, palmitic acid, or soybean, the D/H ratios in urine were measured for up to 119 days, and the biokinetic parameter values were determined for OBT metabolism. The slow degradation rates of OBT could not be obtained, in many volunteers administered glucose and alanine. The estimated committed effective dose for 1 Bq of tritium in palmitic acid varied from 3.2 × 10–11 to 3.5 × 10–10 Sv Bq−1 among volunteers and, for those administered soybean, it varied from 1.9 × 10–11 to 1.8 × 10–10 Sv Bq−1. These results suggest that OBT, present in some ingested ingredients, gives higher doses than the current dose coefficient value of 4.2 × 10–11 Sv Bq−1.},

 abstract = {The biological half-life of tritium was measured in the body water and in brain, liver, lung, kidney, heart and muscle tissues of two groups of kangaroo rats captured in the tritiated environment at Sedan Crater in the Nevada Test Site. These animals had been exposed to tritium in their natural food for their entire lifetime. The rodents were maintained on tritium-free food in the laboratory during the two study periods of five and nine months. At regular intervals, several animals from each group were killed, dissected and lyophilized. Tritium in the body water was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Dried tissue residues were assayed by sealed-flask combustion and liquid scintillation counting. The biological half-life of tritium in the tissue compartment of these uniquely exposed animals was 1.5 to 4 times that of the body water. At the time of trapping, a slight enrichment of tritium in tissue was indicated by the initial ratio of tissue to body water tritium which ranged from 1.2 to 1.6 with an average value of 1.40 ± 0.14.},

    abstract = "{During the past decade, a large number of radiobiological studies have become available for tritium--many of them focusing on the relative biological effectiveness of tritium beta rays. These and previous studies indicate that tritium in body water produces the same spectrum of radiogenic effects (e.g., cancer, genetic effects, developmental abnormalities, and reproductive effects) observed following whole-body exposure to penetrating radiations such as gamma rays and x rays. However, tritium beta rays are of greater biological effectiveness than gamma rays and x rays. For example, tritium in the oxide form is about 2 to 3 times more effective at low doses or low dose rates than gamma rays from 137Cs or 60Co. When tritium is bound to organic molecules, relative biological effectiveness values may be somewhat larger than those for tritium in oxide form. Tritium administered to animals or to cells in vitro as tritiated amino acids results in relative biological effectiveness values that appear similar to those obtained for tritium in oxide form; however, if administered as tritiated thymidine, the relative biological effectiveness values appear to be about two-fold higher. It is clear from the wealth of tritium data now available that relative biological effectiveness values for tritium beta rays are higher than the quality factor of unity generally used in radiation protection. }",
