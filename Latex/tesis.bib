Based on the results achieved, it is premature to initiate Phase 2 and commit to a prototype design for construction and test. Significant improvements must be made in fluor-doped fiber performance in order to use the method for in situ monitoring to verify compliance with current EPA drinking water standards. Additional Phase 1 fiber development work should be performed to increase the fluor dopant concentration above 2% until the self-absorption limit is observed. Continued fiber optimization work is expected to improve the sensitivity limits, and will enable application of the detector to verify compliance with the US EPA drinking water standard of 20,000 pico Curies per liter. However, if the need for monitoring higher levels of tritium in water at concentrations greater than 200,000 pico Curies per liter is justified, then prototype development and testing could proceed either as a Phase 2 stand-alone effort or in parallel with continued Phase 1 development work.},

	title	={Measurements of Tritium Radioactivity in Surface Water on the Upper Silesia Region},
	abstractNote = {Tritium is produced naturally in the upper atmosphere by cosmic radiation. Oxygen atoms combine with the radioactive hydrogen atoms (tritium) to form radioactive water molecules, which reach the Earth in rain. This radioactive water seeps into groundwater, where the tritium decays with time. By measuring the concentration of radioactive tritium in a groundwater sample, geologists can approximate the age of water and pinpoint where the water recharges (replenishes) and discharges (exits) from an aquifer. Geologists can estimate groundwater flow rate and direction, and determine whether water from a shallow aquifer has a ready pathway to a deeper aquifer or not. The possibility of measuring the level of tritium radioactivity gave a chance to use tritium as a natural tracer in the water systems. The measurements of tritium radioactivity in groundwater are becoming important. Especially nowadays when tritium levels in precipitation have returned to pre-bomb values (4-25 TU) and the technogenic emissions of tritium are becoming more significant, and may affect its natural patterns on a local or regional scale. This article presents the results obtained in 1998 by measuring tritium radioactivity in surface-water and precipitation. All analyzed samples were taken during 1995-1996, from the Upper Silesia area. The obtained results confirmed, that tritium concentration has returned to the pre-bomb values.},

	title	={Transmutation Effects observed with Heavy Hydrogen},
	abstractNote = {In our paper “Transmutation of Elements by Protons,”* we showed that the transformation of some of the light elements by protons could be conveniently studied by the use of comparatively low voltages—of the order of 100,000 volts—by generating an intense narrow beam of protons which fell on the target of small area of about 1 sq. cm. In the light of experience of the past year, the installation has been modified in several particulars and entirely reconstructed. By the addition of another 100,000-volt transformer in tandem and the use of appropriate condensers the D. C. voltage available has been raised from 200,000 to 400,000 volts. The main change, however, consists in the use of a horizontal instead of a vertical discharge tube. In place of glass, a corrugated porcelain wall bushing capable of withstanding high voltages has been used to insulate the positive electrode, while the earthed metal casing forming the negative electrode projects through a brick wall. The arrangement of the internal electrodes is, in general, similar to that used in the earlier apparatus. The oil cooling circulation has been improved as the electrodes cannot, now be cooled by radiation alone. As before a magnetic field is applied to sort out the various types of ions generated in the discharge tube. The use of the horizontal tube has many advantages, not only for assembling the controls at convenient points but also in the ease of handling the counting apparatus and absorbing screens. The new installation has worked smoothly and satisfactorily and we have been able to increase the number of disintegration particles available for study by a factor of 10 to 50. The thick brick wall acts as a complete screen for the X-radiation generated in the system.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the Monte Carlo method and numerical model are used to build the electrical model of a SiC-based betavoltaic microbattery using a 3H source, and the influences of structural parameters and the surface recombination effect on the output characteristics of the SiC PN battery are simulated. According to Monte Carlo calculations based on the energy spectrum of the 3H source, the ionization energy deposition approaches the exponential distribution along the depth direction, and most of the 22rs are concentrated near the material surface. The ionization energy deposition data is converted into non-equilibrium carrier information for the numerical simulation of the battery&rsquo;s output characteristics. The simulation results show that the conversion efficiency of the battery rises first, and then decreases with the increase of the doping concentration of the N region. This is because the N region-doping affects the depletion region width and the built-in electrical potential at the same time. After considering the surface recombination effect, the conversion efficiency decreased significantly. Thinning the thickness of or moderately reducing the doping concentration of the P region will weaken the surface recombination effect.},

	abstractNote = {Radiation doses from organically bound tritium (OBT) in foods have been a major concern near nuclear facilities. The current dose coefficient for OBT is calculated using a standard model from the International Commission on Radiological Protection, in which some biokinetic values are not based on human metabolic data. Here, the biokinetics of ingested OBT, and radiation doses from them, were estimated by administering labelled compounds and foods to volunteers, using a deuterium (D) tracer as a substitute for tritium. After the administration of D-labelled glucose, alanine, palmitic acid, or soybean, the D/H ratios in urine were measured for up to 119 days, and the biokinetic parameter values were determined for OBT metabolism. The slow degradation rates of OBT could not be obtained, in many volunteers administered glucose and alanine. The estimated committed effective dose for 1 Bq of tritium in palmitic acid varied from 3.2 × 10–11 to 3.5 × 10–10 Sv Bq−1 among volunteers and, for those administered soybean, it varied from 1.9 × 10–11 to 1.8 × 10–10 Sv Bq−1. These results suggest that OBT, present in some ingested ingredients, gives higher doses than the current dose coefficient value of 4.2 × 10–11 Sv Bq−1.},

 abstract = {The biological half-life of tritium was measured in the body water and in brain, liver, lung, kidney, heart and muscle tissues of two groups of kangaroo rats captured in the tritiated environment at Sedan Crater in the Nevada Test Site. These animals had been exposed to tritium in their natural food for their entire lifetime. The rodents were maintained on tritium-free food in the laboratory during the two study periods of five and nine months. At regular intervals, several animals from each group were killed, dissected and lyophilized. Tritium in the body water was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Dried tissue residues were assayed by sealed-flask combustion and liquid scintillation counting. The biological half-life of tritium in the tissue compartment of these uniquely exposed animals was 1.5 to 4 times that of the body water. At the time of trapping, a slight enrichment of tritium in tissue was indicated by the initial ratio of tissue to body water tritium which ranged from 1.2 to 1.6 with an average value of 1.40 ± 0.14.},

These and previous studies indicate that tritium in body water produces the same spectrum of radiogenic effects (e.g., cancer, genetic effects, developmental abnormalities, and reproductive effects) observed following whole-body exposure to penetrating radiations such as gamma rays and x rays. However, tritium beta rays are of greater biological effectiveness than gamma rays and x rays. For example, tritium in the oxide form is about 2 to 3 times more effective at low doses or low dose rates than gamma rays from 137Cs or 60Co. When tritium is bound to organic molecules, relative biological effectiveness values may be somewhat larger than those for tritium in oxide form. Tritium administered to animals or to cells in vitro as tritiated amino acids results in relative biological effectiveness values that appear similar to those obtained for tritium in oxide form; however, if administered as tritiated thymidine, the relative biological effectiveness values appear to be about two-fold higher. It is clear from the wealth of tritium data now available that relative biological effectiveness values for tritium beta rays are higher than the quality factor of unity generally used in radiation protection. }",

The biological samples include the bioassay (urine), saliva, and nasal tests. The operational samples of the light ion linear accelerator include target cooling water, organic oil, fomblin oil, and smear samples. Sets of standards, which simulate various samples, were fabricated using traceable certified tritium standards. The efficiency of the counter was obtained for each sample. The typical range of the efficiencies varied from 33% for smear samples down to 1.5% for organic oil samples. A quenching curve for each sample is presented. The minimum detectable activity for each sample was established. Typical tritium levels in biological and operational values are presented. All measured values are far below the recommended international limits.}

In one method, a water-immiscible liquid scintillation cocktail was ultrasonically mixed with an aqueous sample to form a water-cocktail dispersion for analysis by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The organic cocktail could then be reused after phase separation. Of the cocktails tested, a toluene-based cocktail showed the highest tritium detection efficiency (7\%). In another technique, the sensitivity of various solid scintillators (plastic beads, crushed inorganic salts, etc.) to tritium in aqueous solutions was measured. The most efficient solid scintillator had a 2\% tritium detection efficiency. In a third method, a large surface area detector was constructed from thin fibers of plastic scintillator. This detector had a 0.1\% intrinsic tritium detection efficiency. While sensitivities of -25 kBq/L of tritium for a short count have been attained using several of these techniques, none can yet reach the environmental level of < 1 kBq/L in aqueous solutions. }

However, the Ebro river samples had a mean activity around 3.6±0.6Bq/l. The nuclear power station of Ascó, which is located on the banks of this river, can be a source of tritium production and introduction into the environment, so a more exhaustive study of these waters was carried out.

This sensitivity is about 200 times better than similar methods using solid scintillants. The LS system features uncomplicated sample pretreatment, precise proportioning of the cocktail and sample water, on-line quench corrections, cocktail consumption as low as 0.15 ml/min, and response to changes in environmental tritium in less than 30 min. Field tests demonstrate that conditions necessary for stable analytical results are achieved.}

The fundamental difference in the proposed detection system consists of changing the state of the tritiated water from the liquid phase to the gas phase and subsequently using any one of a variety of detection methods to detect tritium in the water vapour. Proof-of-principle experiments using an un-optimized heated ionization chamber illustrate the viability of the proposed method. Operation of the experiment as a continuous in-line detection system shows a detection limit of ∼20μCi/l, a detection time constant of 10s, and simplicity and effectiveness of the overall system. It is projected that an optimized heated ionization chamber system using state-of-the-art current measuring circuitry, could yield a detection limit of ∼0.2μCi/l. Furthermore, application of a more sensitive detection system (for example, the gas electron multiplier) is expected to result in additional gain in sensitivity. The advantages of the proposed tritium-in-water monitoring system are: high sensitivity with a detection limit beginning to approach current day batch liquid scintillation detection systems; a truly continuous, on-line tritium-in-water monitor with response time of less than tens of seconds; a detection system potentially applicable for multiple stream monitoring; a system that does not generate any waste; and, a system that overcomes the fouling issues associated with current day on-line LSC systems.}

abstract = {Energy deposition in ionization chambers has been theoretically studied for tritium measurements in gaseous form. A one-dimension model is introduced to establish the quantitative relationship between energy deposition rate and many factors, including carrier gas, gas pressure, wall material, chamber size, and gas temperature. Energy deposition rate has been calculated at pressure varying from 5 kPa to 500 kPa based on some approximations. It is found that energy deposition rate varies greatly for different parameters, especially at low gas pressure. For the same chamber, energy deposition rate in argon is much higher than in deuterium, as much as 70.7% higher at 5 kPa. Gold plated chamber gives highest energy deposition rate in the calculations while aluminum chamber results in the lowest. As chamber size gets smaller, β ray emitted by tritium will deposit less energy in the sensitive region of the chamber. For chambers flowing through with the same gas, energy deposition rate in a 10 L chamber is 23.9% higher than in a 0.05 L chamber at 5 kPa. Gas temperature also places slight influence on energy deposition rate, and 373 K will lead to 6.7% lower deposition rate than 233 K at 5 kPa. In addition, experiments have been performed to obtain energy deposition rate in a gold plated chamber, which show good accordance with theoretical calculations.}

abstract = {At Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK) calorimetry has been used for almost 20 years as the main accountancy method for tritium inventory. An extensive work has been carried out in order to improve the existing calorimeters. This paper covers the efforts made for the upgrade of the IGC-V0.5 calorimeter. We replaced the hardware interface – including the obsolete PC – and developed a new control and data acquisition software. The new software applies a smart automatic process control during measurements, significantly reducing measurement time and possible user errors. The three PID control loops have been re-tuned using the standard closed loop Ziegler–Nichols procedure to find the optimal PID parameters. Five calibration runs have been performed between 0.5mW and 1W, and their results are being presented and discussed.}

The new technique is based on the utilization of x-rays induced by beta-rays from tritium, and it is called beta-ray-induced x-ray spectrometry. The applicability of the same technique to the tritium species retained in solid materials was also discussed. It was concluded from applications to gaseous and aqueous tritium under the static state that the new technique is applicable as an in-line monitor in the fuel circulation system. In addition, it was also shown that the new technique plays an important role in non-destructive evaluation of tritium retained in solid materials such as plasma-facing materials.}

Tritiated water flows in a narrow space surrounded by two X-ray detectors. Basic performance of the new detection system was examined using a poly-methylmethacrylate disk labeled with tritium and tritiated water.

abstract = { AbstractThe β-ray induced X-ray spectrometry (BIXS) is a promising technique to monitor the tritium concentration in a fuel cycle of a fusion reactor. For in-situ measurements of high level tritiated water by bremsstrahlung counting, the characteristics of a low-noise silicon drift detector (SDD) have been examined at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK). In static measurements with constant sample volume and tritium concentration, the bremsstrahlung spectra of tritiated water samples in a concentration range of 0.02 to 15 MBq/ml have been observed. The volume has been kept constant at 5 cm3. The observed spectra are well above the noise threshold. In addition to X-rays induced by beta-rays, the spectra feature X-ray fluorescence peaks of the surrounding materials. No indications of memory effects have been observed. A linear relation between the X-ray intensity and the tritium concentration was obtained and the lower detection limit of the setup has been determined to 1 MBq ml-1, assessed by the Currie criterion. In addition, the spectra obtained experimentally could be reproduced with high agreement by Monte-Carlo simulations using the Geant4-toolkit. It was found that the present detection system is applicable to non-invasive measurements of high-level tritiated water and the SDD is a convenient tool to detect the low energy bremsstrahlung X-rays. }

abstract = {The design, setup and performance of a mass spectrometric system for the analysis of low to very low-level tritium in environmental samples are described. The tritium concentration is measured indirectly by the 3He ingrowth from radioactive decay after complete initial degassing of the sample. The analytical system is fully computer-controlled and consists in a commercial helium isotope mass spectrometer coupled with a high vacuum inlet system. A detection limit of 0.15Bq/kg is routinely obtainable for sample sizes of 20g of water equivalent and an accumulation time of three months. Larger samples (and/or longer accumulation time) can be used to obtain lower detection limits. In addition to the benefit of a lower detection limit, another advantage of this non-destructive method lies in the simplicity of the analytical procedure which strongly limits the risk of contamination. An inter-comparison was successfully performed with the conventional beta counting technique on lyophilized grass samples, in a range of tritium concentrations of environmental interest. It shows that the 3He mass spectrometry method yields results that are fully consistent with the conventional liquid scintillation technique over a wide range of tritium concentrations.}

For the inside and environmental safety of the disposal sites, the tiny outgassing rates leaking out the containers are measured. Presently, the radioactive HT gas is measured by liquid scintillation. However an alternative method—cavity ring down spectroscopy, an isotopically selective laser technique based on molecular spectroscopy—is currently developed and evaluated for tritium measurement in its oxidized form, HTO. Applying this method, the number density of the gaseous HTO sample hold in the optical cavity cell, is derived from the laser beam absorption by vibrational symmetric stretching 2nu1 (R) HTO lines in the 4590 and 4600cm−1 spectral range. To ensure a future accurate HTO measurement, the theoretical line intensities are confronted to the experiment: two tritiated water standards are measured with a dedicated CRDS set-up. Compared to the theoretical database, the line positions are correct (−0.067 to −0.128cm−1), their relative intensities are in agreement with the database, but their absolute intensities are 20% weaker. Among the seven intense lines, the 4596.485cm−1 line (intensity 8.22 10−22cm/molecule) and the 4592.407cm−1 line (intensity 9.83 10−22cm/molecule) are isolated and intense for a sensitive detection. The HTO detection limit with the present set-up is 3kBq (10min), equivalent to 1.8 1012 molecules in the 111cm3 CRDS cell. This detection limit could be improved by a factor 3 by reducing the detection noise.}

The sponge weighs only about 1 g and is in the form of disc of 48 mm diameter and 8 mm thickness. The total surface area of the films is about 3000 cm2. In the coincidence mode of counting, the detector gives 1000 cps for the passage of 3.7 × 104 Bq/cm3 (1 muCi/cm3) of tritiated water. The background in 6 cm thick lead shielding in the laboratory is 0.2 cps, and inside the reactor building it is below 1 cps. The monitor presently scans 18 sample lines in sequence for 5 min each and gives a printout for the activity in each line.}

abstract = { AbstractThe development of a low-level tritium monitor for aqueous effluents has explored several potential techniques. In one method, a water-immiscible liquid scintillation cocktail was ultrasonically mixed with an aqueous sample to form a water-cocktail dispersion for analysis by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The organic cocktail could then be reused after phase separation. Of the cocktails tested, a toluene-based cocktail showed the highest tritium detection efficiency (7\%). In another technique, the sensitivity of various solid scintillators (plastic beads, crushed inorganic salts, etc.) to tritium in aqueous solutions was measured. The most efficient solid scintillator had a 2\% tritium detection efficiency. In a third method, a large surface area detector was constructed from thin fibers of plastic scintillator. This detector had a 0.1\% intrinsic tritium detection efficiency. While sensitivities of -25 kBq/L of tritium for a short count have been attained using several of these techniques, none can yet reach the environmental level of < 1 kBq/L in aqueous solutions. }

The monitor is designed to provide early detection of a small leak of the tritiated heavy water moderator and facilitate rapid isolation procedures. The tritium detector consists of an analysis cell containing 0.1--0.25 mm diameter beads of plastic scintillator interposed between two photomultiplier tubes and standard fast-slow coincidence electronics. A small portion of the effluent stream is first filtered through a series of cartridge filters (0.2 [mu]m final filter) and then chemically treated by ion exchange resin and activated charcoal before reaching the cell. Flow through the detector is [approx]3 mL/min. The tritium effluent water monitor (TEWM) will alarm if the tritium in the outfall exceeds 56 Bq/mL during a 10 minute counting interval. The installation and performance of the TEWM are discussed.},

abstract = { Flux densities of cosmic ray muons and electrons were estimated from the pulse height spectra of cosmic ray charged particles observed using a spherical plastic scintillation detector. In order to obtain the pulse height spectrum of cosmic ray electrons separately from that of cosmic ray muons, the pulse height spectrum of cosmic ray electrons was derived by calculating the probability distribution of energy deposited in a plastic scintillator by electrons alone, utilizing the spectrum of cosmic ray electrons given in literature. Calculation was corroborated by measurement with spherical plastic scintillator detector of cosmic ray muons alone, obtained by passing the particles through a lead shield to eliminate electrons and photons. The aggregate absorbed dose rates in air imparted by cosmic ray muons and electrons thus derived proved upon further adding the contribution of cosmic ray photons to come quite close to the total absorbed dose rate given in literature from measurements performed in Japan. }

The impact of the following parameters on the cleaving process is considered: (i) temperature of the cutting blade, (ii) temperature of the platen holding the fibre, (iii) time allowed for thermal equilibration between fibre and platen, (iv) blade speed, and (v) blade condition. The strong influence of a temperature-dependent phase transition in the polymer on the cleaving process is established. Optically acceptable mPOF end-faces can be achieved but only over a limited range of cleavage conditions.}

abstract = {Geant4 is a toolkit for simulating the passage of particles through matter. It includes a complete range of functionality including tracking, geometry, physics models and hits. The physics processes offered cover a comprehensive range, including electromagnetic, hadronic and optical processes, a large set of long-lived particles, materials and elements, over a wide energy range starting, in some cases, from 250eV and extending in others to the TeV energy range. It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in the C++ programming language. It has been used in applications in particle physics, nuclear physics, accelerator design, space engineering and medical physics.}

abstract = {The optical properties of pure water are basic input data for many geophysical investigations such as remote sensing of surface water and underwater radiative transfer calculations. Knowledge of the spectral properties of components in surface water is required for accurate interpretation of measured reflection and attenuation spectra in terms of their concentrations. Also the sources and sizes of errors in the basic data must be known. Absorption measurements were done with a submersible absorption meter in the temperature range 2.5 till 40.5 degree(s)C. The scattering of pure water is recalculated using the Einstein-Smoluchowski equation. The input for this equation is evaluated and the temperature dependency is included. New values for the absorption coefficient are given based on these results and analysis of data from the literature. Absorption in the wavelength range 300 - 550 nm is lower than presently used values. In the wavelength range about 700 nm the spectrum has a different shape. A formulation of the effect of temperature on the absorption spectrum is given.},

Relic sterile neutrinos in the keV mass range can contribute both to the cold and warm dark matter content of the universe. This work shows that a large-scale tritium beta-decay experiment, similar to the KATRIN experiment that is under construction, can reach a statistical sensitivity of the active-sterile neutrino mixing of sin2o ∼ 10−8. The effect of uncertainties in the known theoretical corrections to the tritium beta-decay spectrum were investigated, and found not to affect the sensitivity significantly. It is demonstrated that controlling uncorrelated systematic effects will be one of the main challenges in such an experiment.}

The specific fluorescence dS/dr is not in general proportional to the specific energy loss dE/dr. By considering the quenching effect of the molecules damaged by the particle on the `excitons' produced by it, it is shown that dS/dr = (A dE/dr)/(1 + kB dE/dr). A and kB are constants, which have been evaluated for anthracene from observations of S and E, and the range-energy data. Curves are computed for the relative response S of anthracene to electrons, protons, deuterons and α-particles of E up to 15 MeV, and these are shown to agree closely with the available experimental results. The method used for evaluating the relative response is applicable to ionizing particles of any nature or energy, and also to the other organic scintillation crystals}

The modules are composed by 340 uncladed scintillating fibers immersed in water and 2 photosensors in coincidence for light readout. Light yield and Birks’ coefficient uncertainties for low energy beta particles is discussed. A study of the detection efficiency according to the fiber length is presented. Discussion on the system requirements and background mitigation for a device with sensitivity of 100Bq/L, required to comply with the European directive 2013/51/Euratom, is presented. Due to the low energetic beta emission from tritium a detection efficiency close to 3.3% was calculated for a single 2 mm round fiber.}
