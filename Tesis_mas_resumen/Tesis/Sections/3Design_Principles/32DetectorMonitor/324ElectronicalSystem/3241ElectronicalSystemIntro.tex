In this section, the PETsys electronics for SiPM arrays and the electronics for single SiPM and PMT characterization are described. For the final TRITIUM prototype there are two different proposals for the DAQ system: the PETsys system and a specific electronic system developed by the Aveiro group to read the TRITIUM monitor with PMTs. This electronics is described in Appendix \ref{App:ElectronicSystemAveiro}.

%In each type of detector configuration, this electronic system will also be different depending on the type of information we want to obtain. For example, it will be different if we want to obtain an energy spectrum as output information or simply a number such as the number of counts per second of our detector or the output electrical current. Each electron system that has been used in our experiment will be explained during this section.
