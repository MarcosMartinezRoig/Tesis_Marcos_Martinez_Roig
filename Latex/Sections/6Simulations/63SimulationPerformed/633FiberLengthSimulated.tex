Another test was performed to find the fiber length that optimizes the tritium detection efficiency. Two different lengths of the scintillating fiber were considered in this study, $1~\meter$ and $25~\cm$. 

For this task, the Tritium-Aveiro prototype was simulated. It consists of $360$ scintillating fibers readout by two photosensors. The photosensors, which consist on a windows glass and photocatode, are located at both scintillating fiber ends. These scintillating fibers are located inside of a teflon tube with two PMMA windows and a optical grease layer with a thickness of $0.5~\mm$ were simulated between the PMMA windows of the prototype and the photosensors. All optical properties mentioned in section \ref{sec:Geant4Environment} were included in this study.

The results of this study are shown in section \ref{sec:ResultsFiberLength} where they are discussed.
