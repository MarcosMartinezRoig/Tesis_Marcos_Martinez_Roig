abstract = { Flux densities of cosmic ray muons and electrons were estimated from the pulse height spectra of cosmic ray charged particles observed using a spherical plastic scintillation detector. In order to obtain the pulse height spectrum of cosmic ray electrons separately from that of cosmic ray muons, the pulse height spectrum of cosmic ray electrons was derived by calculating the probability distribution of energy deposited in a plastic scintillator by electrons alone, utilizing the spectrum of cosmic ray electrons given in literature. Calculation was corroborated by measurement with spherical plastic scintillator detector of cosmic ray muons alone, obtained by passing the particles through a lead shield to eliminate electrons and photons. The aggregate absorbed dose rates in air imparted by cosmic ray muons and electrons thus derived proved upon further adding the contribution of cosmic ray photons to come quite close to the total absorbed dose rate given in literature from measurements performed in Japan. }

The impact of the following parameters on the cleaving process is considered: (i) temperature of the cutting blade, (ii) temperature of the platen holding the fibre, (iii) time allowed for thermal equilibration between fibre and platen, (iv) blade speed, and (v) blade condition. The strong influence of a temperature-dependent phase transition in the polymer on the cleaving process is established. Optically acceptable mPOF end-faces can be achieved but only over a limited range of cleavage conditions.}

abstract = {Geant4 is a toolkit for simulating the passage of particles through matter. It includes a complete range of functionality including tracking, geometry, physics models and hits. The physics processes offered cover a comprehensive range, including electromagnetic, hadronic and optical processes, a large set of long-lived particles, materials and elements, over a wide energy range starting, in some cases, from 250eV and extending in others to the TeV energy range. It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in the C++ programming language. It has been used in applications in particle physics, nuclear physics, accelerator design, space engineering and medical physics.}

abstract = {The optical properties of pure water are basic input data for many geophysical investigations such as remote sensing of surface water and underwater radiative transfer calculations. Knowledge of the spectral properties of components in surface water is required for accurate interpretation of measured reflection and attenuation spectra in terms of their concentrations. Also the sources and sizes of errors in the basic data must be known. Absorption measurements were done with a submersible absorption meter in the temperature range 2.5 till 40.5 degree(s)C. The scattering of pure water is recalculated using the Einstein-Smoluchowski equation. The input for this equation is evaluated and the temperature dependency is included. New values for the absorption coefficient are given based on these results and analysis of data from the literature. Absorption in the wavelength range 300 - 550 nm is lower than presently used values. In the wavelength range about 700 nm the spectrum has a different shape. A formulation of the effect of temperature on the absorption spectrum is given.},

	abstract = {We investigate the sensitivity of tritium β-decay experiments for keV-scale sterile neutrinos. Relic sterile neutrinos in the keV mass range can contribute both to the cold and warm dark matter content of the universe. This work shows that a large-scale tritium beta-decay experiment, similar to the KATRIN experiment that is under construction, can reach a statistical sensitivity of the active-sterile neutrino mixing of sin2o ∼ 10−8. The effect of uncertainties in the known theoretical corrections to the tritium beta-decay spectrum were investigated, and found not to affect the sensitivity significantly. It is demonstrated that controlling uncorrelated systematic effects will be one of the main challenges in such an experiment.}

	abstract = {The scintillation response S of organic crystals depends on the nature and energy E of the incident ionizing particle, of residual range r. The specific fluorescence dS/dr is not in general proportional to the specific energy loss dE/dr. By considering the quenching effect of the molecules damaged by the particle on the `excitons' produced by it, it is shown that dS/dr = (A dE/dr)/(1 + kB dE/dr). A and kB are constants, which have been evaluated for anthracene from observations of S and E, and the range-energy data. Curves are computed for the relative response S of anthracene to electrons, protons, deuterons and α-particles of E up to 15 MeV, and these are shown to agree closely with the available experimental results. The method used for evaluating the relative response is applicable to ionizing particles of any nature or energy, and also to the other organic scintillation crystals}

abstract = {In this work we present simulation results for a modular tritium in-water real-time monitor. The system allows for scalability in order to achieve the required sensitivity. The modules are composed by 340 uncladed scintillating fibers immersed in water and 2 photosensors in coincidence for light readout. Light yield and Birks’ coefficient uncertainties for low energy beta particles is discussed. A study of the detection efficiency according to the fiber length is presented. Discussion on the system requirements and background mitigation for a device with sensitivity of 100Bq/L, required to comply with the European directive 2013/51/Euratom, is presented. Due to the low energetic beta emission from tritium a detection efficiency close to 3.3% was calculated for a single 2 mm round fiber.}
