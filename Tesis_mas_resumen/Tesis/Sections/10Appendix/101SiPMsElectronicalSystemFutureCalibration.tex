The electronics employed to characterize the SiPM S13360-6075 model is described in this appendix. This electronics consists of three different PCBs connected through HDMI connectors:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{} In the first PCB, shown in Figure \ref{subfig:PCB1}, up to 8 SiPMs and one temperature sensor are connected. This PCB is placed inside a light-tight box from Thorlabs \cite{ThorlabsCompany}. This black box has a small hole of $1~\mm$ diameter, prepared to introduce an optical fibre\footnote{The optical fibre used is BCF-98 from Saint-Gobain \cite{OpticalFibers}} to illuminate SiPMs with a 430L LED from Thorlabs \cite{LEDThorlabs}. The spectrum of this LED, shown in Figure \ref{subfig:LEDSpectrum}, was measured with a spectrometer. The emission peak is located at $436~\nm$ with a FWHM of $19~\nano\meter$. With the help of this LED, the light emission of the TRITIUM scintillating fibres was simulated to calibrate the SiPMs at the working wavelength. 

\item{} In the second PCB, shown in Figure \ref{subfig:PCB2}, the signals of the SiPMs are summed and amplified by a factor either $G=4187$ or $G=10761$, depending on the input resistance of the oscilloscope, $50~\varOmega$ or $1~\mega\varOmega$ respectively. This PCB includes a differential amplifier to reduce the electronic noise of the system.

\item{} In the third PCB, shown in Figure \ref{subfig:PCB3}, the different input and output signals are rearranged to avoid crosstalk. The input signals are the supply voltage of the SiPMs and the PCBs ($\pm 6~\volt$) and the output signals are the temperature sensor signal and the sum of the SiPM signals. The output signal of the third PCB is recorded by a MSO44X oscilloscope from Tektronix \cite{Oscilloscope}.
