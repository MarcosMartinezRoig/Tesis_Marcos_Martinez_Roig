The soft background component is suppresed by a lead shield inside which the TRITIUM detector is placed. This lead shield is efficient for suppressing radiation that originate from the Earth's natural radioactivity and the soft component of cosmic radiation with energies below $200~\MeV$. This lead shield consists of $158$ low intrinsic radioactivity lead bricks of $25~\mm$ thickness. The bricks are chevron shaped, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:LeadBrick}, specially designed for a perfect fit and easy assembly. As can be seen in Figures \ref{subfig:TwoLayers} and \ref{fig:LeadBricksAndArrangement}, these lead bricks are arranged in two layers with a total thickness of $50~\mm$.

An aluminium structure capable of supporting the total weight of $2.4$ tons of lead bricks, shown in Figure \ref{fig:AluminiumStructure}, was designed by the Mechanical Engineering Department of the CENBG.

The internal room of the lead shield is divided into two parts, as indicated in Figure \ref{fig:AluminiumStructure}. The larger one has internal dimensions of $90.5 \times 41 \times 51~\cm^3$ and is used to place the TRITIUM detector. The smaller one, of dimensions of $33 \times 41 \times 51~\cm^3$, contains the DAQ system of the detector. The external dimensions of the lead shield are $148 \times 60 \times 70~\cm^3$ and its total weight is $2.5$ tons.
