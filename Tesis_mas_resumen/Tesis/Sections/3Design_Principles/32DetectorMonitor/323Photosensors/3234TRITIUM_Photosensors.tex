Two different types of photosensors are proposed for the TRITIUM monitor, PMTs and SiPM arrays. Each type of photosensor has advantages and disadvantages and must be tested to determine the most suitable option. PMTs are used in the TRITIUM prototypes developed by the Aveiro experimental group while SiPM arrays are used in the TRITIUM prototypes developed at IFIC.

%PMTs with and without gain have also been used in Valencia to perform various laboratory measurements such as R\&D studies with fibres, characterization of the active veto and test measurements of the TRITIUM prototypes developed.

The IFIC group has chosen SiPM arrays as photosensors for their advantages over PMTs, which are compactness and robustness, necessary to work during several years without supervision, larger efficiency for detection of photons in the visible range and more economical price of both photosensors and electronics. % sytem necessary to feed them and process and analyze their output signal. However, the SiPM arrays have a higher dark count rate compared to the PMTs, which is a relevant disadvantage for the purpose of TRITIUM monitor since low activities of tritium are intended to be measured.
