This section reports experimental measurements of the scintillating fiber parameters relevant for tritium detection, such as collection effficiency and conditioning uncertainty. Error bars are included in all graphs displayed but they are too small to be visible. Thousands of scintillating fibers are used in the TRITIUM detector which were prepared and conditioned prior to characterization studies or tritium detection. Therefore, various mechanical and electronical devices were developed to automatically prepare large number of fibers simultaneously.
