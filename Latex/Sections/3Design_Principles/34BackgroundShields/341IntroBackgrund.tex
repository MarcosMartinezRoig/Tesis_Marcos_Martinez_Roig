The aim of the background rejection system is to reduce the radioactive and cosmic background that affects the TRITIUM monitor. The TRITIUM project follows the ALARA principle for the tritium activity measurement, that is, to measure a tritium activity "as low as reasonably achievable". The detection limit of tritium activity is set by the uncertainty of the background measured by the TRITIUM detector, since tritium activities with differences from the background below this uncertainty cannot be resolved. Therefore, the background uncertainty must be reduced as much as possible. The total uncertainty is given by the squared root sum of the statistical uncertainty $\sigma_{st}$ and the systematic uncertainty $\sigma_{si}$. Because of the Poissonian nature of the process, the statistical uncertainty is given by the square root of the measured activity $A_{m}$ which can be reduced by minimizing the background events.

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{T}^2 = \sigma_{st}^2 +\sigma_{si}^2; \qquad \qquad \sigma_{st;bac} = \sqrt{A_{m;bac}}
\label{eq:SquareSumUncerainty}
\end{equation} 
The background rejection system of the TRITIUM monitor suppress the background of the TRITIUM detector, reducing the statistical component of the background uncertainty.

The background of TRITIUM has two different sources. On the one hand, the radioactive elements present in the crust of the Earth, mainly $\ce{^{40}K}$ and elements from the four natural radioactive series, listed in Table \ref{tab:NaturalRadioactiveSeries}. On the other hand, the cosmic ray radiation. The primary cosmic radiation, of extra-terrestrial origin, is composed of high-energy particles, mainly protons and $\alpha$ particles, which interact with the Earth's atmosphere and generate a shower mainly composed by muons, electrons, photons and neutrons.

Cosmic radiation depends on several parameters like the longitude, latitude, and the solar activity cycle. The spatial distribution of cosmic rays, mainly muons, follows a $\cos^2(\theta)$ distribution with the zenith angle, $\theta$. 

Two different techniques are employed for background suppression:

\begin{enumerate}

\item{}  The soft background component, with energy below $200~\MeV$, is stopped by a lead castle, described in section \ref{subsec:SetUpPassiveShield}.

\item{} The hard background component, with energy greater than $200~\MeV$, is harder to stop and the technique employed is the use of a cosmic veto in anti-coincidence with the TRITIUM detector, reported in section \ref{subsec:SetUpActiveShield}. %that is, we will save the measured tritium event just when we don't measure any hard cosmic event in time coincidence.

\end{enumerate}
