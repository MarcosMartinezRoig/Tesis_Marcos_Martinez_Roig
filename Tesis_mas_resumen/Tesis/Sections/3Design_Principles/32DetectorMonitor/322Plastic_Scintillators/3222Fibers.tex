Plastic scintillators are easy to machine to any desired shape. The chosen shape for TRITIUM detector is the fibre, specifically, commercial fibres BCF-12 from Saint-Gobain Crystals Inc \cite{DataSheetBCF12Fiber}. This type of fibre was chosen as the result of a comparative study \cite{TFGAlberto} among some of the best-known commercial manufacturers. The BCF-12 fibres consist of a scintillating polystyrene core with the possibility of being covered by polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) claddings. % (smaller refractive index than core in order to archieve a critical angle) or a multicladding (second cladding) with even smaller refractive index.

When a particle deposits all or part of its kinetic energy in a scintillating fibre, photons are produced in the fibre core as a result of the fluorescence process. The number of photons produced depends on the scintillating efficiency and its value is around $2.4\%$ for the BCF-12 fibres, which means that a scintillation yield of about $8000$ photons per $\MeV$ is produced for a mip. For instance, for tritium electrons of $18.6~\keV$ these fibres emit at least 149 photons, since electrons of these energies are not mips. The emission spectrum of the fibres employed in this work is shown in Figure \ref{fig:EmissionSpectrumFibers}.

\end{figure}

The scintillation light is guided to the sensitive part of the photosensor according to the Snell's law \cite{Snell}. The guiding mechanism is determined by the interface between the core and the surrounding material. When a photon hits this interface, it is refracted (and therefore lost) following the Snell equation \cite{Snell}, 
\begin{equation}
n_0~sen\theta_0 = n_1~sen\theta_1
\label{eq:Snell}
\end{equation}
where $\theta_0$ is the incident angle formed by the photon and the normal to the surface of the first medium with refractive index $n_0$, and $\theta_1$  is the refraction angle formed by the photon and the normal to the second medium with refractive index $n_1$. If the surrounding material has a lower refractive index than the core of the fibre, as it is the case with scintillating fibres, there exist a critical angle, $\theta_c$, beyond which photons will be totally reflected ($\theta_1 = 90\degree$) and therefore kept within the fibre as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Fiber_physic},
\begin{equation}
\theta_c = \arcsin\left(\frac{n_1}{n_0} \right)
\label{eq:CriticAngle}
\end{equation}

The trapping efficiency or photon collection efficiency is defined as the efficiency of the scintillator to guide photons. For BCF-12 fibres with optical clad this efficiency is between $3.4\%$ and $7\%$ per meter of fibre (depending on the emission point, it is minimum on the fibre axis and maximum near the core-clad interface). In Figure \ref{fig:Fiber_physic}, the light collection in a fibre is illustrated.

%Therefore, from the $148$ photons initially created by a tritium decay electron of $18.6~\keV$ and assuming a light yield of $8000$ photons$/\MeV$, around $137$ photons are guided along the $20~\cm$ fibre length of the TRITIUM detector, assuming a $7\%$ trapping efficiency and an exponencial attenuation with the fibre length. Thus, the output signal is small and is in the energy range of the spectrum where electronic noise is already significant. ->>CHECK THAT

The cladding material has a higher refractive index than air and water. Therefore, it increases the critical angle and reduces the light collection. However, it is useful for protecting the core surface from dirt and aggressive external agents that would reduce the light collection. Three different cases are shown in Table \ref{tab:CriticalAngles}, where the cladding effect is illustrated.

As can be seen, the critical angle for uncladded fibres surrounded by water or air is smaller than for cladded fibres, which implies a larger trapping efficiency. However, in practice, it is difficult to achieve a perfect air-core or water-core interface, and this affects light collection. As commercial claddings are thicker ($30~\micro \meter$) than the mean free path of tritium decay electrons in water (around $5~\micro\meter$), cladded fibres are not an option for the TRITIUM detector. Hence, special attention is needed for achieving a good enough water-core interface. To achieve this goal a special method was developed in the ICMOL laboratory\footnote{ICMOL, \textit{Instituto de Ciencia Molecular}, is a research institute located in the \textit{Parc Cient√≠fic} of the University of Valencia.} for preparing fibres for tritium detection, described in section \ref{sec:CharacterizationScintillatingFibers}. The relevant parameters of the scintillating fibres used for the TRITIUM detector are given in Table \ref{tab:ParametersFibersBCF12}.
