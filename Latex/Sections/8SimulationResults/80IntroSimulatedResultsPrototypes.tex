This chapter shows the results obtained in the simulations carried out in the TRITIUM experiment, described in chapter \ref{chap:Simulations}. This is divided in three different sections. The first one presents the results of the simulations used to improve the design of the TRITIUM detector while the second and third exhibits the results obtianed for the simulation of the TRITIUM monitor, consisting of a study of the tritium detection with the TRITIUM-IFIC 2 prototype, section \ref{sec:ResultsSimulatedTRITIUMIFIC2}, and a study of the effect of the background rejection system, section \ref{sec:ResultsSimulatedBackgroundRejectionSystem}.
