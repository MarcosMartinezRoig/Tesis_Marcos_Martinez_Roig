A study to find the optimal fiber length was carried out. Two different lengths of scintillating fibers, $1~\meter$ and $20~\cm$, and two different tritium source activities were used, $0.5~\kilo\becquerel/\liter$ and $2.5~\kilo\becquerel/\liter$, were considered. 5 detectors were simulated for the case of a $20~\cm$ fiber length to have the same active area. The advantage for using long fibers is their large active area for the same number of photosensors which would reduce the price of the TRITIUM monitor. However, short scintillating fibers reduce photon absorption, which increases the tritium detection efficiency per active area unit. The Tritium-Aveiro prototype, consisting of $360$ scintillating fibers of $2~\mm$ diameter, was simulated. 

The number of photons produced in a scintillating fiber per tritium electron for all the electrons that reach the scintillating fiber and for only those that generate photons detected in time coincidence by the photosensors are compared in Figure \ref{fig:PhotonsFibersYesNoPhotosensors}. Tritium events that produce a large number of photons are almost always detected but events that produce few photons are seldom detected, resulting in a peak centred at around $25$ photons.

%Regarding the fiber length study, 

The number of counts per hour during a week are shown in Figure \ref{fig:CountsOver60minDifferentLength} as a function of time for both tritium activities and fiber lengths studied. 5 times greater signal is seen for the shorter fiber length in both cases, due mainly to the lower absorption of photons in the shorter scintillating fibers and the leakage of some photons due to partial photon collection in the fiber. In addition, non simulated effects like the dirty or mechanical imperfections of scintillating fibers increase this photon loss effect.
