Two preliminary prototypes, TRITIUM-IFIC 0 and TRITIUM-IFIC 1, are shown in this section, which were designed, developed and built at the IFIC workshop.

These prototypes were thought to be a small scale of the final TRITIUM detector module and they were used to learn about tritium detection, to detect possible problems in their designs and to verify the improvements applied to them.
