The scintillation yield provided by the manufacturer, $8000~\text{phot.}/\MeV$, is only valid for minimum ionizing particles (MIP). As tritium electron energies do not correspond to MIP particles, the output light generated by the scintillating fibers was studied. For this task, the energy deposition of tritium electrons in scintillating fibers and their subsequent emission of scintillation photons was included in to the simulation.

When particles that are not MIP are detected in plastic scintillators, a light quenching effect affects the proportionality between the output light per unit of path length, $\frac{dL}{dx}$, and the energy deposited per unit of path length, $\frac{dE}{dx}$, through the so-called Birks coefficient\cite{BirksPaper}.
\begin{equation}
\frac{dL}{dx}= S\frac{\displaystyle{\frac{dE}{dx}}}{1+k_B\displaystyle{\frac{dE}{dx}}}
\label{eq:birkscoefficient}
\end{equation}
where S is the scintillation yield, provided by the manufacturer. The value of $k_B=0.126~\mm/\MeV$, typically used for scintillators based on polystyrene \cite{BirksCoefficient}, was taken for the Birk's coefficient. The objective of this section is to quantify the significance of this effect and how it affects to the tritium detection.

A verification test of the energy deposition of tritium electron on scintillating fibers was carried out. In Figure \ref{fig:InitialFinalTritiumEnergy} the initial energy of simulated tritium electrons that reach the scintillating fibers is compared to the energy deposited in scintillating fibers, red histogram.

A shifth to lower energies is observed, which is caused by the loss of energy of tritium electrons in water. A cut of around $1~\keV$ is observed in both energy distributions, produced by the default energy threshold of $990~\eV$ in the G4EmLivermorePhysics physics list.

Figure \ref{fig:BirksEffectinEnergyDistribution} shows two distributions of number of photons produced in scintillating fibers by tritium events, one in which the quenching effect is not considered ($k_B=0$) and the other in which the Birks coefficient is applied ($k_B=0.126~\mm/\MeV$).

\caption{Energy distribution of photons produced in the scintillating fiber, Birks coefficient without (red histogram) with (blue histogram)\cite{SimulationPaperCarlos}.\label{fig:BirksEffectinEnergyDistribution}}
\end{figure}  

A distribution with a peak of around 40 photons per tritium event and a maximum of around 150 photons is obtained when the quenching effect is not considered. A significant reduction of the output light is observed when the Birks coefficient is taken into account, producing a distribution peaked at around $10$ photons and a maximum of $110$ photons. The quenching effect is also observable in Figure \ref{fig:2DimPlotBirks}, where the number of produced photons as a function of the energy deposited in the fiber is displayed in a bidimensional plot. In this figure, in addition to a reduction of the number of photons produced per unit of energy deposited, a broader distribution is obtained when the Birks coefficient is considered, indicating an increase of the fluctuations of energy deposition.
