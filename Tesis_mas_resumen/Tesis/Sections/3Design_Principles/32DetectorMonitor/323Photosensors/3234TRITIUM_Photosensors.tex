Two different types of photosensors are proposed for the TRITIUM monitor, PMTs and SiPM arrays. Each type of photosensor has advantages and disadvantages and must be tested to determine the most suitable option. PMTs are used in the TRITIUM prototypes developed by the Aveiro experimental group while SiPM arrays are used in the TRITIUM prototypes developed at IFIC. The IFIC group has chosen SiPM arrays as photosensors for their advantages over PMTs, which are compactness and robustness, necessary to work during several years without supervision, larger efficiency for detection of photons in the visible range and more economical price of both photosensors and electronics.
