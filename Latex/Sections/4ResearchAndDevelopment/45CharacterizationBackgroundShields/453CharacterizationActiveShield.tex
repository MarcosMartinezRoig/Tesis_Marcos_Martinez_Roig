The characterization of the active shield (cosmic veto), which was carried out using PMTs as photosensors, is reported in this section. Measurements of the cosmic veto using SiPM arrays has already started and their replacement will be as soon as possible. 

The quality of the veto wrapping, shown in Figure \ref{fig:LayersVeto}, was checked. This study was done at the level of one detector so the configuration of the electronics is the one given in Figure \ref{subfig:ElectronicConfiguraiton2PMT}. The surface of the veto was divided in 9 parts, shown in Figure \ref{fig:MappingPoints}, in which a gamma source was placed.

\end{figure}
Two different tests were made for this task:
\begin{enumerate}

\item{} The improvement of the veto signal due to wrapping. A $\ce{^{137}Cs}$ source was placed at point 2 and a energy spectrum was measured with the veto before wrapping. Next, the measurment was repeated after wrapping. The spectra obtained are shown in Figure \ref{fig:VetoCoverageImprovement}.

\caption{Measurement of a radioactive source $\ce{^{137}Cs}$ with the TRITIUM cosmic detector with and without wrapping.\label{fig:VetoCoverageImprovement}}
\end{figure}

The spectrum of the wrapping veto is shifted to the right, which means that more photons (a factor two) are collected per event. No improvement was obtained in the number of events detected, only in the collection efficiency.

%a comparison is made between the measurement of cover and uncover veto, placing the gamma source in 3 different points, 1, 2 and 3. This study is used 

\item{} The spatial uniformity of the signal in the wrapped veto was evaluated. For this task, a mapping was carried out, which consisted of placing a $\ce{^{60}Co}$ source at each point and measuring the number of events detected in the same time window. This test was done for two different veto modules and the energy spectrum obtained was integrated. The count rates obtained are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:MappingVetos}. It can be observed that the veto signal has a uniform response on its whole surface, giving a fairly similar counting rate in all the points measured.

Next, both vetos in time coincidence was studied, so the configuration of the used electronics was that of Figure \ref{subfig:ElectronicConfiguraiton4PMT}. The goal was to find the conditions in which the detection of cosmic events is optimized. This optimization consists of, on the one hand, finding the minimum high voltage of PMTs for which their efficiency is stable, and, on the other hand, finding the maximum threshold of the discriminator\footnote{The threshold is the voltage value that the PMT output signals must exceed to contribute to the cosmic detection} before starting to loss cosmic events. For higher voltages and a smaller thresholds, a plateau of the counting rate should be obtained.

The counting rate was measured for several high voltages at fixed threshold and for several thresholds at fixed high voltage, plotted in Figure \ref{fig:HVandThresholdsPLateaus}. To find the optimal conditions, the amplification line of the electronics was eliminated and the output signal of the coincidence module was connected to a CAEN Quad Scaler And Preset Counter-Timer module, N. 1145, \cite{ScalerDataSheet}. The counting rate was measured in a time window of $300~\second$. In Figure \ref{subfig:HVPLateauVetos}, the counting rate at several high voltages for three different thresholds, $60~\milli\volt$, $100~\milli\volt$ and $200~\milli\volt$ is plotted. As it can be observed, there is a minimum high voltage for each threshold, $700~\volt$, $730~\volt$ and $780~\volt$ respectively, at which the plateau start. This minimum voltage is higher when the value of the threshold increases, as it should. Analogously, the counting rate for several thresholds and fixed high voltage was measured for three different high voltages, $750~\volt$, $800~\volt$ and $850~\volt$, plotted in Figure \ref{subfig:ThresholdsPlateau}. There is a maximum threshold for every high voltage used,  $140~\milli\volt$, $270~\milli\volt$ and $450~\milli\volt$ respectively, at which the plateau ends. This maximum threshold increases with high voltage, as it should. The voltage chosen was $800~\volt$ since it is on the plateau for the three thresholds and the threshold chosen was $200~\milli\volt$ which is on the plateau for the selected high voltage.

With this setting, the energy spectrum of cosmic events was measured, shown in Figure \ref{fig:EnergySpectrumCosmicVeto}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{4ResearchAndDevelopments/43CosmicVetos/Cosmic_Energy_Spectrum_36_cm_Landau_Function.pdf}
\caption{Energy spectrum measured with the cosmic veto.\label{fig:EnergySpectrumCosmicVeto}}
\end{figure}
As expected, this energy spectrum fits well to a Landau function. The cosmic ray rate determined from the area of this spectrum is $2.5~$event$/\second$. The expected cosmic rate, calculated in section \ref{subsec:SetUpActiveShield}, is $2.9~$event$/\second$, so the efficiency of the active veto developed in TRITIUM experiment for cosmic event detection is $85\%$, which is a usual value for the efficiency of plastic detectors to mips.

Finally the detected cosmic ray rate versus the distance between the two cosmic veto was obtained. The energy spectrum was measured for five different distances, namely $10~\cm$, $20~\cm$, $36~\cm$, $40~\cm$ and $50~\cm$. The spectra are plotted in Figure \ref{subfig:EnergySpectrumsSeveralDistanceVeto}. The energy spectrum in Figure \ref{fig:EnergySpectrumCosmicVeto} was also included. As it is expected, the counting rate decreases with the distance but the spectrum shape remains the same. The integrated spectra as a function of distance, plotted in Figure \ref{subfig:LinearFitSeveralDistanceVeto}, was fitted to a second degree polynomial which allows to estimate the cosmic rate for a given veto distance.

%As can be seen, the shape of the spectrum is the same because the energy of the detected events is the same (cosmic events) but the quantity of their events is less for greater distance. The reason for that is that when the distance is increased, the solid angle formed by the active veto is smaller.

%The detected cosmic events was calculated by the area integral and they are represented in Figure \ref{subfig:LinearFitSeveralDistanceVeto} as a function of the distance between both detectors, where a linear fit has been added. With this linear fit, the detected cosmic rate can be easily known if the working distance is changed.

%También se realizaron varias medias para ver como afecta una fuente gama. Discutir con Pepe como plantear esta medida o si merece la pena ponerla o no.

%Como es de esperar esta deja muy poca señal en el centelleador ya que este tiene muy poca eficiencia para gammas.
