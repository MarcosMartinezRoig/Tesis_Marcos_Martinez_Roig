This study is done to choose the length of scintillating fibers used in the TRITIUM detector that optimize the tritium detection efficiency. To do so, the complete TRITIUM-Aveiro 0 prototype was simulated, in which the energy deposition and photon propagation was included.






As it is described in section \ref{}, two length are simulated to compare the results, $1~\meter$ and $0.25~\meter$.
