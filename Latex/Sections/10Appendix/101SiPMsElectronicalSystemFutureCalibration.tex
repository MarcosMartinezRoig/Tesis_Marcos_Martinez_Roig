This appendix shows the electronic system designed to perform a complete characterization of the SiPM S13360-6075 model. This consists on three different PCBs\footnote{PCB, Printed Circuit Board}, shown in Figure \ref{fig:PCBs_LEDSpectrum}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{} The first PCB, shown in Figure \ref{subfig:PCB1}, is used to organize the SiPMs and sensor temperature. This PCB place up to 8 different SiPMs and a temperature sensor and arrange their output signals on two HDMI connections. This PCB is placed inside a special black box, from Thorlabs company \cite{ThorlabsCompany}, that has a high degree of light tightness. This black box has a small hole of $1~\mm$ diameter, prepared to introduce an optical fiber\footnote{The optical fiber used is BCF-98 from Saint-Gobain company \cite{OpticalFibers}} to iluminate SiPMs with an incoherent light source. The light source utilized is a LED, model 430L from Thorlabs company \cite{LEDThorlabs}, which gives an spectrum shown in Figure \ref{subfig:LEDSpectrum}. The spectrum was experimentaly measured with a spectrometer and fitted to a Gaussian function. It can be seen that the emission peak of this LED is palced at $436.3$ with a FWHM\footnote{The FWHM parameter, Full Width at Half Maximum, of a Gaussian fit can be calculated from its sigma using the equation: FWHM$=2.35 \cdot{} \sigma$} of $19.1~\nano\meter$. With the help of this LED the light emission of the fibers used in TRITIUM experiment is simulated to calibrate the SiPMs at the working wavelength. 

\item{} The second PCB, shown in Figure \ref{subfig:PCB2}, sums the different signals of the SiPMs and amplify them by a factor $G=4187.5$ or $G=10761.88$, depending on the input resistance of the oscilloscope, $50~\varOmega$ or $1~\mega\varOmega$, respectively. This PCB uses a differential amplification that reduce the electronic noise of the system and is connected to the first PCB through two HDMI feedthroughs.

\item{} The third PCB, shown in Figure \ref{subfig:PCB3}, rearranges all the different input and output signals in an HDMI connection to avoid crosstalk between different signals. This PCB is connected to the second PCB trought a HDMI feedthrough.

The input signals are the supply voltage of the SiPMs and the supply voltage of the PCBs ($\pm 6~\volt$) and the output signals are the temperature sensor signal and the summed signal of all SiPMs.

The output signal of the third PCB is connected to an oscilloscope, model MSO44X from Tektronix \cite{Oscilloscope}, that records the data which are subsequently analized by ROOT\footnote{ROOT is a framework for data processing, based on C ++ and object-oriented technology, developed at CERN and widely used in nuclear and particle physics.}.
