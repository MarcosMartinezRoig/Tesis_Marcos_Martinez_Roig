This section shows experimental measurements of the scintillating fiber parameters that most affect the tritium detection, such as its collection effficiency or their uncertainty in its conditioning process.

Thousands of scintillating fibers are used in TRITIUM detector which need to be prepared and conditioned prior to use in characterization studies or tritium detection. Therefore, various mechanical and electronical devices were developed to automatically prepare a lot of fibers at the same time.
