Radioactive liquid sources were prepared from $1.86~\gram$ (uncertainty of $0.05\%$) of tritiated water, purchased from PTB \cite{PTB}. The activity of this tritium source was $26.8~\mega\becquerel/\gram$ (uncertainty of $2.24\%$, reference date of 1/1/2017).

This source was dissolved in $500~\milli\liter$ (uncertainty of $0.05\%$) of hiper pure water (conductivity of $0.72~\mu\text{S}/\cm$), resulting in a solution of $500~\milli\liter$ of tritiated water with an activity of $100~\kilo\becquerel/\gram$ (uncertainty of $2.24\%$), that is $99.7~\kilo\becquerel/\liter$ (uncertainty of $2.24\%$).

%It had an activity of $26,8 \pm 0.6 ~\mega\becquerel/\gram$ measured with the TRI-CARB 2810 system, based on liquid scintillation readout by PMTs.
