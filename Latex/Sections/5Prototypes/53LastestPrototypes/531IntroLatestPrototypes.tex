This section reports on prototypes TRITIUM-Aveiro and TRITIUM-IFIC 2. A different design was employed in both prototypes so that they can safely allow the reading of a large number of fibers arranged in a straight position with two photosensors in time coincidence. Better tritium detection efficiency was obtained in these prototypes through the use of more fibers than in the preliminary prototypes and time coincidences of the photosensors. Furthermore, the activity of the radioactive liquid source of tritium used to fill these prototypes was much lower than that of the first prototypes to be able to measure their low detection level. The design of both prototypes is to decide the final design of the TRITIUM monitor.
