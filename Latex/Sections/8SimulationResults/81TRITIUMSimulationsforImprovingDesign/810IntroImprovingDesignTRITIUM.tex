Several simulations were performed during the development of the TRITIUM detector design. They were used to quantify the effect of several proposed designs which allow us to choose the one which optimize the tritium detection. The properties that were studied are the diameter and length of the scintillating fibers. As the tritium electrons has a very low mean free path, the shape of the simulated tritium source was also studied to optimize the consuming time and computing resources used.
